This new experience enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to build and manually test their SCIM integration metadata before submission to the OIN. This reduces the time needed for the OIN team to review and validate that the SCIM integration functions as intended, which shortens the time to publish in the OIN. This experience also incorporates communication processes in Salesforce, enabling improved collaboration internally within Okta teams and externally with ISVs. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-app-overview/">Publish an OIN integration overview</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/scim/main/">Submit an integration with the OIN Wizard</a> guide.
