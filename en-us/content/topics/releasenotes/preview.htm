You can add or remove users from groups based on their identity and access requirements. This ensures that changes made to user access in Okta are reflected in AD. When you use Okta Access Certifications to revoke a user's membership to an AD group, the removal is reflected in AD.

				Okta can only manage group memberships for users and groups imported into Okta using the AD integration. It isn't possible to manage users and groups that weren't imported through AD integration. It's also not possible to manage users and groups that are outside the organizational unit's scope for the integration using this feature.
