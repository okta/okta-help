		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

You can suppress them completely, or send them to admins only. This unlocks testing scenarios which warrant using production user directories, and prevents end users from getting test emails. It also allows extensibility for customers who would like to use a third party email sender through Hooks or Workflows. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/brands/#email-template-settings">Email template settings</a>.</p>

Flows that are delegated to an admin appear on the Delegated Flows page where they can be invoked without signing in to the Workflows Console. This gives super admins more granular control over their admin assignments. See <a href="../automation-hooks/delegated-flows/about-delegated-flows.htm" class="MCXref xref">Delegated flows</a>.</p>

Dynamic routing rules use expression language to match users to any IdP, based on attributes of their login object. This reduces the volume and complexity of routing rules and the manual effort of managing them.

When this is configured, Okta only accepts SAML requests signed using the certificate associated with the app integration. Having signed SAML requests also resolves scenarios where the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL requested after authentication can be one of several domains or URLs. When a Service Provider sends a signed authentication request, Okta can accept dynamic ACS values as part of the SAML request and posts the SAML assertion response to the ACS value specified in the request.

Okta now supports the use of private/public key pairs (<span class="msgblock">private_key_jwt</span>) with OpenID Connect-based Identity Providers. Additionally, the Signed Request Object now also supports the use of private/public key pairs.
