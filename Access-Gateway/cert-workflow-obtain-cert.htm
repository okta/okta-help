            <h2><a name="Certific"></a>Certificate Authority provided certificates</h2>
            <p>Okta recommends the use of Organizationally Validated certificates or Extended Validation certificates whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Common Certificate authorities include: <a href="https://comodosslstore.com/">ComodoSSL</a>, <a href="http://www.digicert.com/">Digicert</a>, <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, <a href="http://www.thawte.com/">Thawte</a>, and others.<br />Okta does not recommend or endorse any particular certificate authority.</p>
            <p>To obtain a CA based certificate, follow the procedure detailed by your certificate authority.</p>

            <h2><a name="Wildcard"></a>Wildcard certificates</h2>
            <p>A wildcard certificate is a digital certificate that is applied to a domain and all its subdomains. A wildcard notation typically consists of an asterisk, followed by a period, followed by a domain name. <br />For example, <span class="code">*.exampledomain.com</span>. <br /><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> supports the use of wildcard certificates. 	Extending a single certificate to subdomains rather than purchasing separate certificates saves money and minimizes administration.  However, the downside is that if the certificate is revoked or expired, then all subdomains are impacted. </p>
            <p>To obtain a wild card certificate, follow the procedure detailed by your certificate authority.</p>

            <p class="noteContent">Password Protected Certificates:</p>
            <p class="noteContent"><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> does not support password
protected certificates. If you upload a password protected certificate, you must re-enter the certificate’s password  every
time <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> restarts, otherwise the gateway will not function property.</p>
