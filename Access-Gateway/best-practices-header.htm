        <h1>Best practices: Header applications</h1>
        <p>The most common <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> integration involves legacy Web Access Management (WAM) applications based on values contained in request headers.</p>
        <p>WAM solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>May be custom build, or third party solutions such as Oracle Access Manager, CA Siteminder, or others.</li>
            <li>Rely on header attributes for single sign-on.</li>
            <li>Were often  deployed behind proxy web-servers such as Apache. </li>
            <li>Involves validating application header contents before testing with back end protected web resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">When configuring an application for header based single sign-on make sure you review the steps to place the application behind a proxy server. Many Access Gateway troubleshooting situations arise not from SSO but because the application was incorrectly configured for a proxy server.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Review attribute requirements</h2>
        <p>Before integrating any header-based application examine all required and expected header elements. Ensure that the application definition in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> includes all required attributes.</p>
        <h2>Application was previously served by Apache HTTP Server</h2>
        <p>In situations where protected web resources were previously fronted by Apache, Apache may have added header elements to requests before they were forwarded. <br />The Apache <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html" target="_blank">mod_header</a> file often defined all required header fields and can be used as a source of information for expected header content.</p>
        <h2>Proxy and load balancers</h2>
        <p>Many applications use the terms web proxy and load balancer interchangeability. Examine any documentation related to web proxies, load balancers, and related content to determine application attribute value requirements. </p>
