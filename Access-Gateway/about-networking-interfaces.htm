        <h1>Network interfaces</h1>
        <p> The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> virtual appliance uses network interface to communicate. By default <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> ships with a single defined interface. However, you can add additional interfaces. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> requires at least one network interface to communicate and can support up to ten.</p>

            <h2>Defining Network Interfaces</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Defining a network interface varies by virtual environment. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS EC2 uses the concept of an elastic network interface. Elastic network interface is a logical networking component that is defined and then attached to an instance of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. At this point, it acts as a virtual network card. Elastic interfaces can be attached and detached from instances maintaining their configuration. You must create an elastic network interface when creating an AWS EC2 based instance of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. </li>
            <li>Microsoft Azure supports the concept of a virtual network interface. Azure network interfaces allow a VM to communicate with the internet, Azure, and Azure-based services. By default, one interface is created for each virtual machine, but you can enable or add additional interfaces. </li>
            <li>Oracle Virtual Box supports up to four network interface adapters. By default, only one interface is defined, but you can enable additional interfaces using the Networks tab in VM settings. </li>
            <li>VMWare Fusion includes a single network interface by default and supports up to ten devices. The performance of the interface is limited only by the host computer. You can define additional interfaces using VM&#160;settings.</li>
            <li>VMWare VSphere/ESXi networking features enable communication between virtual machines on the same host, between virtual machines on different hosts, and between other virtual and physical machines. When creating a VM, a single network interface is provided. However, you can add additional network interfaces as required.</li>
        </ul>
