        <h1>Okta as IdP</h1>
        <p>After deploying <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, one of the first tasks 
	is to configure an Okta org as an identify provider. After it is configured, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> interacts with the configured Okta org to provide a variety of services with the most common one being authentication. </p>
        <p>
            <br /><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> authenticates with an Okta org in one of two ways:</p>
        <h2>Okta org initiated flow</h2>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/access-gateway/to-okta-arch.png" id="img_new" />
        <p>In an Okta initiated flow, the user accesses an Okta tenant, signs in using a browser or hand held device(1). Okta authenticates(2) the user and directs them to their set of defined applications. When the user selects an app tile representing an application managed by <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, the Okta org provides credential information, usually in the form of a SAML&#160;assertion to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, which then directs the request to the client application(4).
        </p>
        <h2>Direct to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> initiated flow</h2>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/access-gateway/to-oag-arch.png" />
        <p>In the Direct to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" style="font-style: normal;" /> initiated flow, a user accesses an application proxied by <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> directly (1). <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> then asks Okta for authentication (2). The Okta org then authenticates(3) and returns the appropriate assertion(4) to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> then forwards the request to the underlying protected application resource(5). </p>
