        <div>
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            <h3>Port Selection</h3>
            <p>Okta recommends using a port number higher than 2048. Many operating systems have access restrictions on ports 2048 and lower.</p>
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>What is the frequency of log events?</h3>
            <p>The frequency of log events depends on the activity in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. Application updates, Data Store configuration, AUDIT, and MONITOR events generate log entries.</p>
            <h3>Do I need to restart <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> after configuring log forwarders?</h3>
            <p> No. Once configured, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> immediately begins to send out events, as they occur.</p>
            <h3>I'm running a log server and my instance went down. Are events during that period lost?</h3>
            <p>When there's no recipient for the event stream, the events are dropped. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> doesn't cache events. However, you can still download the logs for the time period where events were missing. See <MadCap:xref href="admin-settings-log-download.htm">Download logs</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <h3>I've changed the logging level but I&#160;still see all log events on my forwarder.</h3>
            <p>Changing the verbosity level on log downloads has no effect on the log levels and events sent to log forwarders. All log events are always sent to log forwarders regardless of the logging level. Configure a remote filter to remove unwanted log events on the log forwarder.  </p>
