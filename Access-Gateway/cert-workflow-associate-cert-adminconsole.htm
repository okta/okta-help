        <h1>Associate a default host certificate using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" /></h1>
        <div>
            <p>You can associate a default host certificate and configure the default virtual hostname.</p>
            <p>Before you associate a default host certificate, upload it to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. See <MadCap:xref href="cert-workflow-upload.htm">Upload certificates</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <h2>Associate a default host certificate</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" /> in a browser.</li>
                <li>Click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Settings</span><span class="uicontrol">Certificates</span></span>.</li>
                <li>Enter a value in the <span class="uicontrol">Search</span> field to narrow the list of certificates. You can also click <span class="uicontrol">Generate self-signed certificate</span> to generate a new certificate.</li>
                <li>Select the default host certificate that you want to associate with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />.</li>

                <p>Old annotation with warning about old content:</p>
                <p>This topic is marked DNP after a review by Matt Selnekovic in the slack channel. This method of association is very dangerous and we don't want to advertise it. William Edor suggested that a UI change be made to allow admins to toggle the display of the Admin console as an app to associate a certificate with. When that occurs, then the documentation should be updated to reflect that process, but this current state should not be available to customers.</p>
                <p>This work originally occurred as a result of a JIRA opened by Keith Lane.</p>

                    <li>Append <span class="userinput">?ADV</span> to the URL and press enter to show the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" /> application on the <span class="uicontrol">Applications</span> tab. For example, if you had a gateway named <span class="url">gw-admin.examplegateway.com</span>, the complete URL would be <span class="url">https://gw-admin.examplegate.way.com/#!/applications?ADV</span></li>
