        <h1>Application integration overview</h1>
        <p>One of the most common activities performed by administrators is web application integration. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> applications represent the connection between an external resource and the internal application protected by <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> is built and deployed to sit in front of a secure web application. When <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> receives a request from a user, depending on the application policy, it will let the user access the <span class="disableGlossary">web</span> <span class="disableGlossary">app</span> without requiring any authentication. Initially, it redirects the user to Okta for authentication (per tenant specific Okta <span class="disableGlossary">Authentication</span> Policy). After authentication, the Okta tenant sends a <span class="disableGlossary">SAML</span> assertion to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. Additionally, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> performs its own authorization checks on the URL before allowing the user's request to be sent to the web application.</p>
        <p>You can use the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> <span class="disableGlossary">Admin</span> UI to configure <span class="disableGlossary">web application</span> definitions. After you save an application definition in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, an application tile is created in the associated Okta tenant. All settings for the Okta tenant application are created automatically without any further administrator action. Within <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, the application creation process first identifies the application to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. Once created, HTTP headers, <span class="disableGlossary">Kerberos</span> tokens, and other details,  including authorization policies, are defined. For web applications with their own authentication, you must integrate the web application with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> to avoid the application from presenting its own login page to the user and possibly resulting in a double authentication. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> uses HTTP headers and Kerberos tokens as primary mechanisms  for web application integration.</p>

            <br /><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> supports adding various common and proprietary application types, such as applications based on header, cookie, Kerberos, Oracle, and so on.<br />Application definitions are broken up into three main areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Essentials</span> - Common configuration such as front end and protected resource URL as well as other common characteristics</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Advanced</span> - Configuration for session duration, content rewriting, certificates and more</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Behavior</span> - Configuration to customize out of the box behavior such as what to do on error conditions, sign out, session expiration, and more. </li>
        </ul>
