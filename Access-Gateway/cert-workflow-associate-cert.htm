        <h1>Associate certificates</h1>
        <p>Associate a certificate with an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> application. </p>
        <p>By default, when you create an app, the system generates and assigns a self-signed wildcard certificate to the app. This certificate includes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Common Name</span>:&#160;Based on the associated public domain specified in the <span class="wintitle">Essentials</span> tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">SANs</span>: None.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Issuer</span>:&#160;<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Expiration</span>:&#160;Valid for two years from date of assignment.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two ways that you can associate certificates  with back-end applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Generate">Generate a self-signed certificate</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#Select">Select an uploaded certificate</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <div MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
            <p>To associate a certificate with an existing application:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open a browser to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" />.</li>
                <li>Select the <span class="wintitle">Applications</span> tab.</li>
                <li>Select an application and open it by clicking the pencil icon( <img src="../../Resources/Images/access-gateway/icon.pencil.png" />) in the associated row. </li>
                <li>In the <span class="wintitle">Settings</span> tab, expand <span class="uicontrol">Certificates</span>. This displays the list of currently known certificates and their details (such as common name, SANs, issuer, and expiration date).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h2><a name="Generate"></a>Generate a self-signed certificate</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Generate self -signed certificate</span>. This creates a self-signed certificate and assigns it to the app, replacing any previously assigned certificate. This replacement doesn't remove uploaded certificates.</li>
                    <li>Modify application settings as required. Click <span class="uicontrol">Done</span>. </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2><a name="Select"></a>Select an uploaded certificate</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>If required, upload a certificate. See <MadCap:xref href="cert-workflow-upload.htm">Upload certificates</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                    <li>Select a certificate from the list of available certificates. Use the <span class="uicontrol">Search</span> field to narrow the set of certificates by Common Name.</li>
                    <li>Modify application settings as required. Click <span class="uicontrol">Done</span>. </li>
                </ol>
