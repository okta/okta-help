        <h1>Manage certificates and certificate chains</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> uses certificates in several ways, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Providing trust relationships between a browser and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> on behalf of a protected web resource, such as a back-end application. </li>
            <li>Authenticate requests using client certificate chains.</li>
            <li>TLS termination and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following pages describe how to use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> to manage certificates, manage certificate chains, associate certificates with back-end applications and define certificate chain-based authentication.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> uses two interfaces to manage certificates and certificate chains, as well as associate certificate and certificate validation behavior with applications.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" /> to manage certificates and certificate chains.</li>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" /> to associate certificates with a back-end protected web resource and define certificate chain behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">When certificates are uploaded in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" />, they aren't synced with the worker nodes until they're associated with an application and the application is then saved. The application must also be updated whenever the associated certificate is updated in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" />.</p>
        </div>
