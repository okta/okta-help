        <h1>Selective upgrade</h1>
        <p>Selective upgrade, also referred to as upgrading to a specific version, is the process of taking an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> node and upgrading that node from its current version to any of the follow on versions up to, and including the most recently released version. </p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/access-gateway/selective-upgrade-about.png" />
        <p>Selective upgrade supports the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current version <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-08" /> (assumed to be most recent) - Upgrade not possible, no newer versions exist.</li>
            <li>Current version <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-07" /> - Upgrade to version <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-08" /> possible. </li>
            <li>Current version <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-06" /> - Upgrade to version <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-08" />, or <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-07" /> are possible. </li>
            <li>Current version <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-05" /> - Upgrade to version <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-08" />, <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-07" />, or <MadCap:variable name="oag-versions.2021-06" /> are possible. </li>
            <li>And so on.</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="noteContent">Selective upgrade is performed using the standard upgrade process and must be performed on each cluster node individually. Typically such updates are done using a rolling upgrade process where nodes are taken out of rotation, updated and returned back to the cluster. </p>
