        <div>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> enables you to back up and restore configuration information.</p>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> <span class="disableGlossary">admin</span> nodes automatically back up configuration information each night. Using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> Console, administrators can perform the following tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rename or delete backup files that are located off-site, in the cloud, or in source-management systems.</li>
                <li> Restore from a backup file to return a system's configuration to a previous state.</li>
                <li>Initiate backup operations on local and remote computers.</li>
                <li>Download backup files for use in other environments.</li>
                <li>Move a configuration between environments by downloading a backup file, and then uploading and restoring it to another environment.</li>
                <li>Move backup files to off-site or cloud storage.</li>
                <li>Restore an admin node in a staging environment with a backup file from a development environment.<br /></li>
            </ul>

            <h2><a name="Backups"></a>Backup operations</h2>
            <p>Backup files are used to restore a system to a prior system state, move a configuration between environments, and store configurations off-site. They are encrypted when you download them, but you must protect them with a password when you store them on another computer or storage location. Backups are performed automatically each night at 12:00 AM UTC-5. You can also run a backup operation on demand, such as after a configuration change. Each backup file is kept for 30 days, after which they are no longer available.</p>
            <p>Backup files contain the following information:<br /></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="wintitle"><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Provider full name"></MadCap:variable> (IdP)</span>: The list of Identity Providers available to your org's users.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Application configurations</span>: The configurations that you've created for access your environment's applications.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Custom configurations</span>: Custom configurations that you've created for your environment.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Okta org (IdP)</span>: The configuration associated with your Okta org.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Data Stores</span>: All auxiliary Data Store information.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Logging configuration</span>: The logging configuration of your Okta org.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><a name="Restores"></a>Restore operations</h2>
            <p>In <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, a restore operation returns an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> instance configuration to a specific state or point in time. You select a backup file and then the system onto which you want to restore that file. If you discover an issue with an environment after modifying a configuration, applying a patch, or other scenarios, you can restore the last known good configuration to that environment. You can also move or copy a known good configuration from one environment to another.</p>
            <p>Backup and restore operations support high-availability clusters.</p>
