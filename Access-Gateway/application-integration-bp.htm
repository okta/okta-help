        <h1>Application integration FAQ</h1>
        <h2><a name="Can"></a>Can I modify application or SAML attributes in my Okta org?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>No. After you add an app using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" />, don't modify the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> application attributes in your Okta org.  And never change an application's SAML attributes in your Okta org.</p>
            <p>Okta orgs don't push application or SAML attribute changes to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. If you changed these attributes in your Okta org, and then made application or SAML updates in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> changes overwrite the changes you made in your Okta org.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="Modifyin"></a>Can I modify application groups, such as Everyone, in both Okta and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />?</h2>
        <p>Yes. You can assign an application to a group, such as Everyone, in both the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" /> and the Okta org. Changes you make in one environment are updated into the other.</p>
        <h2><a name="Common"></a>Can I make configuration changes in the Okta Admin Console?</h2>
        <p>Yes. You can modify groups and sign-in policies, hide or display the application tiles, and activate and deactivate the application using the Okta Admin Console.</p>
        <h2><a name="Deleted"></a>How do I completely delete an application from <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />?</h2>
        <p>You can use the Okta Admin Console to deactivate and delete applications that you set up in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. However, the application isn't deleted from <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. To completely remove an application from <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, you must delete it using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" />. Next,   in your Okta org, disable the app and delete it from your org.</p>
        <h2><a name="Accident"></a>I&#160;accidentally deleted an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> application from my Okta org. Can I restore it?</h2>
        <p>Yes. You can recreate <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> applications  in your Okta org by opening the application for edit in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. When <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> asks if you want to recreate the application, select <span class="uicontrol">Yes</span>. Any changes that you made in the Okta Admin Console, such as changing group assignments, are lost and you must reconfigure them. </p>
        <h2><a name="Okta"></a>Can I process data in a third-party product before Okta passes it to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />?</h2>
        <p>Yes. There are several ways to do this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configure an Okta <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/saml-hook/">SAML Hook</a>  to change data. If the app is updated in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, the hook information is lost. </li>
            <li>Use Universal Directory to store the modified data in a custom attribute in the Okta user profile.</li>
            <li>Use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> Data Stores to connect to either an LDAP or SQL database. You can use that Data Store to add additional application data.</li>
        </ul>
