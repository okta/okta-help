            <p>Deploying  Okta <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> on your own hosted solution or on a cloud-based computing platform (such as AWS), is a well-defined process. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> is a high-performance appliance that you install on your hosting solution of choice. It uses your DNS and networking solutions to protect applications and services, and it requires specific tasks be completed as part of the installation.</p>
            <p>Tasks to deploy <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> in your environment include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Review all prerequisite tasks, including sizing and capacity planning detailed in <MadCap:xref href="about-oag-prereqs.htm">[%=okta-feature-names.Access Gateway%] deployment prerequisites</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                <li>Choose an appropriate hosting environment for the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> virtual appliance. See <MadCap:xref href="support-matrix.htm">Supported technologies</MadCap:xref>. </li>
                <li>
                Download and install the latest OVA. Depending on environment selected, the deployment and configuration of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> varies.
