            <h2><a name="Backgrou"></a>Background</h2>
            <p>In general, Secure Socket Layer(SSL)&#160;certificates are used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish a secure connection between a browser and a server.</li>
                <li>Encrypt communication to ensure that sensitive information is safe.</li>
                <li>Authenticate an organization's identity. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><a name="certifi"></a><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> certificate use</h2>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> uses certificates to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Support HTTPS connectivity between an external load balancer and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />.</li>
                <li>Securely transmit traffic between <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> and an Okta tenant.</li>
                <li>Provide secure HTTPS communications between&#160;<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> and protected resources, which are also called back-end applications. </li>
                <li>Provide secure HTTPS communications between the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" /> and a client browser.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Applications use Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates to define a secure relationship between an end user and an application. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> acts as a proxy by redirecting application requests to a back-end application, providing the required certificate on behalf of the back-end application. </p>
            <p>How TLS&#160;termination is implementation determines how certificates are provided:<br /></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> provides the certificate when TLS passes through the load balancer and terminates at <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />.</li>
                <li>The load balancer is responsible for supplying certificates when TLS terminates at the load balancer. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> isn't involved in certificate management. </li>
            </ul>

        <h2><a name="Self"></a>Wildcard, self-signed, and uploaded certificates</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> uses three types of certificates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wildcard certificates: When an application is integrated with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated based on the value of the <span class="uicontrol">Public Domain</span> field. Other applications that have similar domains can use the same wildcard certificate. For example, if the certificate uses the wildcard <span class="code">*.mysite.com</span>, then apps with matching domains (for example, <span class="code">abc.mysite.com</span>)  use that certificate. </li>
            <li>Self-signed certificates: Optionally, an application integration can use a self-signed certificate, which must be generated explicitly from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" />, and is specific to the public domain. A self-signed certificate is only&#160;applied to a single application. </li>
            <li>Uploaded certificates: Uploaded certificates are those certificates obtained from a trusted certificate authority and uploaded to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> or a load balancer. When used with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />, an unloaded certificate is first uploaded using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" /> and then associated with an application.</li>
        </ul>
