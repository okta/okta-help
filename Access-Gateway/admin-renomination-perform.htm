On <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> clusters running versions prior to v2020.8.3 update the admin node and the nominated admin node to version 2020.08.3 or later before proceeding with admin renomination. <br /><br />To bring an entire cluster up to the latest version of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> based on Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL):<br /><ol><li>Add a new worker node based on OEL to the cluster.</li><li>Follow these instructions to make the new  worker node the admin node.</li><li>When complete decommission the previous admin node.</li><li>Replace each worker node with new nodes based on the latest version of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> based on OEL.</li></ol></p>

            <br />When performing admin renomination there are primarily two <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> nodes involved: the original admin node and a node nominated as the new admin. &#160;The two admin node strategy limits concerns about loss of configuration and data during the renomination process.</p>
        <p>During the process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The admin node manages the overall process, working with each worker to ensure they process proceeds smoothly.</li>
            <li>The worker node that's brought in to become the new nominated admin, then takes over as admin and  ensures the process completes successfully. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the process is complete, the nominated worker node takes over with the existing admin node still being available, but as a standalone instance. Afterward you can decommission the original admin node or return it to the cluster as a worker. <br /></p>

            <p>Admin renomination is composed of the following tasks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select and prepare a worker node to become the new admin - This step requires either adding a new worker node running <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> v2020.08.3 or later, or upgrading an existing worker to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> version 2020.08.3 or later.<br /></li>

                <li>Prepare Admin node - This step involves upgrading the cluster admin node to  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> version 2020.08.3 or later or installing the cluster-manager-package. </li>
                <li>Using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" /> connect to the nominated worker node and begin the admin renomination process.</li>
                <li>Using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" /> connect to the existing admin node and continue the admin renomination process.</li>
                <li>Using the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" /> return to the nominated worker node and determine its IP address.</li>
                <li>Add appropriate DNS entries for the replacement admin node. <br /></li>
