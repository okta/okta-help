        <h1>Advanced <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> policy</h1>
        <p>Advanced policy configuration allows <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> application administrators to create policy tailored to a specific URI, and need. Advanced policy is created by adding a script to a given policy. You can use these scripts  to extend the basic policy mechanism to meet specific customer requirements.  </p>
        <p>Advanced policies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Associated with a given policy and declared in the Advanced section of the associated policy.</li>
            <li>Executed with the location block of the underlying NGINX&#160;server instance.</li>
            <li>Able to access environment, session, and query values.</li>
            <li>Able to include conditional statements.</li>
            <li>Able to rewrite URLs as well change return codes.</li>
        </ul>
