        <h1>Introduction to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /></h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> enables you to protect access to on-premises apps that don't support federation with the user authentication and single sign-on capabilities of <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. It's a reverse proxy-based virtual application that integrates with legacy apps using HTTP headers and Kerberos tokens, and offers URL-based authentication. Since <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> is behind the firewall, it lets external users access on-premises web-based apps without the need for traditional VPNs. When deployed, all browser traffic flows first to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> and then to the back-end protected app. This allows <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> to monitor every request that a user accesses, perform authorization, and add the appropriate headers and tokens to the request.</p>

            <h2><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> components</h2>
            <p>An <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> deployment includes the following components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> org: Manage your apps, users, single sign-on, and multifactor authentication (MFA) in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. Then use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> to apply the user authentication features of <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to your on-premises apps.</li>
                <li>Virtual appliance: <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> is a virtual appliance. You can download it from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard" /> in your Okta org. Go to <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Settings</span><span class="uicontrol">Downloads</span></span> and then deploy it in a virtual environment. You can deploy as many instances as you need to meet reliability and throughput requirements. </li>
                <li>Virtual environment: <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> must be hosted in a virtual environment. See <a href="support-matrix.htm">Okta Access Gateway Supported Technologies</a> for a list of supported virtual environments.</li>
                <li>Protected apps: <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> protects header-based, SAML, custom web, Kerberos, and other apps.</li>
                <li>Policies: Create granular policies to protect access to apps based on group membership, IP&#160;address location, and many other factors.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Tools"></a><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> administration tools</h2>
            <p>The following <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> administration tools are available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access&#160;Gateway UI" />:<ul><li>Initially configure an instance of a virtual application</li><li>Administer <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> and <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> organization integration</li><li>Define, administer, monitor, and manage protected applications</li></ul></li>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway CMD" />:<ul><li>Configuring high availability</li><li>Managing underlying networking</li><li>Monitoring and logging</li><li>Enabling and disabling the support network</li></ul></li>
