        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> applications are the building blocks of application security. They define how <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> provides access to underlying protected resources. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> has a large catalog of on-premises applications and uses application-specific integration wizards to define application instances. Each application integration is application type-specific. Some application types, such as Kerberos-based applications, require custom settings before they're integrated with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" />. </p>
        <p>Applications are composed of the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Essential Settings</span>: The essential or core requirements of all applications. These requirements can include an application, public URL, protected Web resource, and application type-specific fields.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Advanced Settings</span>: Settings that target specific features (for example, session time-out, duration, and so on). These settings are usually optional.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Policies</span>: An optional element that uses attributes to define mechanisms to control access to application features. For example, a group attribute might be used to define a policy that allows members of a group to access a specific page. For example, members of the finance group are allowed to access the payroll page, while non-members are denied access.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Behaviors</span>: An optional application element that controls application behavior based on conditions, such as HTTP&#160;return codes or errors. For example, on sign out, an application might redirect to a specific page, while redirecting to different pages on general errors or HTTP status codes.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Attributes</span>: Attributes map Okta tenant information to some elements of an application. For example, Okta tenant attributes can be mapped to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Gateway" /> header application attributes, cookie attributes, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
