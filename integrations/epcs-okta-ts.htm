        <p id="solution">To troubleshoot the Hyperspace integration:
                        <ol><li>Examine Okta syslog for events.<br />If no events are shown then the EPIC agent may be misconfigured. <br />Possible causes include, user is not configured or enrolled in assigned Okta MFA factor. </li><li>Ensure that the user is assigned to the group associated with the Hyperspace app.  </li><li>Ensure that the user is enrolled in MFA.  <br />Has the user previously connected into Okta and enrolled?  If not enroll the user before continuing. </li><li>Ensure that the app sign-on policy is prompting for MFA for the assigned users of the created Okta group for ePCS users.</li></ol></p>
