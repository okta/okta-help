        <h1>SAML&#160;integration advantages </h1>
        <div>
            <p>Some integrations let you choose either RADIUS or SAML 2.0 to interoperate with Okta.</p>
            <p>SAML&#160;integrations offer the following advantages over RADIUS:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>SAML integrations provide a rich, intuitive, and consistent login experience, while RADIUS uses a text-based challenge that has inconsistent formatting. Using SAML can reduce user training and support requirements, and its consistent sign in experience makes users less susceptible to phishing attempts.</li>
                <li>SAML integrations provide greater security by exposing credentials to fewer parties.</li>
                <li>SAML integrations use a simplified infrastructure. They involve minimal maintenance and don't require on-premises agents. The user agent (for example, browser, VPN client, and so on)  transmits messages in a secure manner, so there's no need for the service provider (firewall or application server) to connect to Okta.  Federation is established using a one-time exchange of SAML metadata. This one-time setup establishes trust for ongoing transactions.</li>
                <li>Okta SAML integrations are robust and include adaptive MFA and provisioning.</li>
