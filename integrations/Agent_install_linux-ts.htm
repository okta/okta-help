        <h1>Troubleshoot the Linux RADIUS agent</h1>
        <h3>The RADIUS agent upgrade from v2.16.0 to 2.17.x fails</h3>
        <p>The RADIUS agent v2.16.0 cannot be upgraded directly to version 2.17.0 or later.</p>
        <p>When upgrading from v2.16.0 to a newer version, a new installation is required. The current agent must be uninstalled and the new agent installed.</p>
        <h3>The RADIUS agent upgrade to 2.15.x fails to restart on CentOS and other Linux based operating systems.</h3>
        <p>The RADIUS agent, after upgrade, should automatically restart and does not.  </p>
        <p>When upgrading from earlier versions to v2.15.1 or later, a restart is required. The newly updated agent must be restarted by hand after upgrade. See <MadCap:xref href="Agent_install_linux-manage.htm">Manage the agent</MadCap:xref> for additional details for starting and stopping RADIUS agents under Linux.</p>
        <h3>After an upgrade the RADIUS agent does not accept requests</h3>
        <p>In certain situations the RADIUS agent may not automatically restart after upgrade.</p>
        <p>Confirm that the RADIUS agent is  running using a comment similar to <span class="code">systemctl status ragent</span></p>
        <p>If the agent is not running, restart using a command similar to <span class="code">systemctl start ragent</span>. See also <MadCap:xref href="Agent_install_linux-manage.htm">Manage the agent</MadCap:xref>.</p>
