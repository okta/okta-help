        <p>The Apps widget displays the number of successful user sign-ins across your org’s SAML/WS-Fed, OIDC, SWA, and other apps over time. The widget gives you a convenient overview of your org’s sign-in activity and helps you quickly identify org-wide trends and issues.</p>
        <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Time period</span> dropdown menu provides a list of time periods (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, and Last 30 days) that you can use to filter the widget.</p>
        <p>You can click the <span class="uicontrol">View all apps</span> link to go directly to the <span class="wintitle">Applications</span> page. You can also click the name of an app to view its integration settings.</p>
