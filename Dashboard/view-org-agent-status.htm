        <h1>View your org agents' status</h1>
        <p>Use the <span class="wintitle">Status</span> section to view the real-time performance updates and the agents that your org uses. There are four codes for agents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Operational:</span> All agents and app instances are green.
            </li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Degradation</span>: An agent is down but the app instance is still connected through a backup agent.
            </li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Disruption:</span> All agents for an app instance are down and the app isn't connected.
            </li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Failed to load</span>: The agent status retrieval failed. Click <span class="uicontrol">Refresh page</span>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A red indicator appears next to app instances or agents with an aggregate status of <span class="uicontrol">Degradation</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Disruption</span>. Click <span class="uicontrol">Learn more</span> to open the new Agents page.</p>
        <div>
            <p>You can click <span class="uicontrol">Agents</span> in the <span class="wintitle">Status</span> section to view:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Agent tabs for RADIUS, IWA, and RUM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    App instances and agent tabs for Active Directory (AD), LDAP, and on-premises multifactor authentication.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            Each tab displays groupings of associated agents. The groupings list individual agents’ status, description, connection, and version in sortable columns:
            <ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Status</span>:  Operational, disruption, degradation, or inactive. The aggregate of these individual agent codes appears in the <span class="wintitle">Agent Status</span> section of the Admin Dashboard.
                </li><li><span class="uicontrol">Description</span>: The agent ID
                </li><li><span class="uicontrol">Connection</span>: Live, down since (with the applicable time stamp), or N/A
                </li><li><span class="uicontrol">Version</span>: The version number of the agent
</li></ul><h3>For RADIUS agents only</h3><p>You can hide agents regardless of their status and filter the list of RADIUS agents by hidden and visible agents.</p><p>Hiding an agent removes it from the default list of visible agents and its status isn't included in the count in the <span class="wintitle">Agent Status</span> section of the Admin Dashboard. To hide a RADIUS agent, select the <span class="uicontrol">Mark as hidden agent</span> option from the dropdown box associated with the agent. Similarly, select <span class="uicontrol">Mark as visible agent</span> to make it visible.</p><div class="noteOkta"><img src="../../Resources/Images/assets/Icons/Notes/Help.png" class="noteImgFloat" title="Note" alt="Note." /><p class="noteContent">Hiding a RADIUS agent doesn’t deactivate it. To deactivate an agent, you must manually deactivate it from the device that it’s installed on.</p></div></div>
