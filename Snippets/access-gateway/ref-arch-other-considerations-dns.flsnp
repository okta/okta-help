        <p>DNS is typically split between external and internal domains. All external URLs, such as <span class="url">[appN|consumer-app1].example.com</span>, would be served externally and point to the Access Gateway instance.  Internal URLs, used by Access Gateway such as <span class="url">[protd-N|consumer-app1].internal-example.com</span>, would be served by internal DNS. </p>
