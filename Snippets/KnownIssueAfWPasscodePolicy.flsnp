        <p>Known Issue: (Applies to Android devices running versions 7.1 or 7.1.1; fixed in 7.1.2) After an admin strengthens a group's work profile passcode policy, end users are prompted to update their passcode to comply with the updated policy. However, when end users respond to the prompt, their device passcode is updated instead of their work profile passcode. If the end user's <span class="uicontrol">Security</span> settings allow different device and work profile passcodes, they are prompted continually to update their work profile passcode until they change it in their device settings.</p>
