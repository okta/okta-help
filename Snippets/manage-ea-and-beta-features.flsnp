        <p>Super admins can bypass <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Support and enable self-service Early Access and beta features for their org. In Help Center, EA features display a banner indicating whether they are self-service or require additional configuration by Okta Support.  </p>

            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="task steps/Settings_Features.flsnp" /> All features that your organization is eligible to use based on your subscription are listed.</li>
            <li>Select whether you want to auto-enroll your org in all future Early Access features. Super admins will receive an email when their org is auto-enrolled in an EA&#160;feature or if the auto-enrollment fails. Note:&#160;Auto-enroll also includes Early Access features with known limitations, without prompting you to view and accept the limitations.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>.</li>

                <li>If a feature that you want to enable has a dependency, it is grayed out until you enable the dependency by clicking on the link or selecting the check box for that dependency. </li>
                <li>If you want to remove a feature that is a dependency for other enabled features, you are prompted to remove the dependent feature.</li>
                <li> If you want to enable a feature that has known limitations such as compatibility restrictions or other limitations, you will see a dialog box describing the limitations and can either accept them to enable the feature, or <span class="uicontrol">Cancel</span>. </li>

                <li>Early Access features that become Generally Available are removed from the list and automatically enabled for all eligible orgs.</li>
                <li>You can  track the availability of Early Access features on the Product Roadmap available in the <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/OktaProductRoadMap">Okta Help Center</a>.</li>
                <li>Beta features  are used to validate features in non-production environments. Betas  have a small subset of customers and offer limited documentation and support.</li>
                <li>Open betas are available to everyone. Super admins who enroll are emailed a  link to the documentation and a feedback document.&#160;The feedback link is not available after you remove the beta feature, so it's important to provide feedback prior to ending the beta.</li>
                <li>Closed betas are restricted to customers with specific use cases. Betas that have passed their testing period are also listed here. These closed betas are no longer available for enrollment.  </li>
