        </MadCap:variable> also lets you prevent <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>-sourced users from getting locked out of their <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> accounts as a result of too many failed <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> sign-in attempts. This feature adds the ability to block suspicious sign-in attempts from unknown devices. <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> can detect whether sign-in attempts are coming from a known or unknown device. A known device is one that has been previously used to sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>. An unknown device has never been used to sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>.</p><p>If <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> determines that the failed sign-in attempts are coming from an unknown device, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> locks out new sign-in attempts from unknown devices, but allows sign-ins from known devices.  This helps prevent malicious parties from disrupting <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> users' access to their accounts and enhances account protection.</p><p>The minimum lockout duration for lockouts triggered by unknown devices is two hours unless the admin configures a custom duration. If a legitimate user needs to sign in from a new device during this time, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> initiates the self-service account unlock flow (if the org admin has enabled it). When the user unlocks the account, they're allowed to sign in from the new device. </p></body>
