            <h3>Phishing-resistant account sync across devices</h3>
            <p>As of July 5, 2023, this feature is available in the latest app version.</p>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> users who want to authenticate with the same account on another device can now sync their devices with Bluetooth in a phishing-resistant way. By doing so, they can add the existing <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> account directly to the other device without signing in to the End-User Dashboard. With this feature, users who lost their phone can recover their <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> account by syncing a new device with an active enrollment. See <a href="https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=eu&amp;id=csh-ov-ios-add-acc-bluetooth" target="_blank">iOS documentation for end users</a>.</p>
