        To enable RADIUS authentication with Okta, you must install the Okta RADIUS server agent and configure one or more RADIUS applications in the Okta admin console.  Admin console RADIUS applications allow Okta to distinguish between different RADIUS-enabled apps and support them concurrently. In addition,   Okta RADIUS applications support policy creation and assignment of the application to groups.
		<p>For more information on configuring the RADIUS App see <MadCap:xref href="../../../Topics/integrations/Okta_Radius_App.htm">Configuring RADIUS applications in Okta</MadCap:xref>.</p></body>
