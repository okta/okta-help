        <p>Electronic Prescribing for Controlled Substances (EPCS) transmits prescriptions for controlled substances electronically from physicians to pharmacies. Additionally, EPCS adds security by requiring auditing, multi-factor authentication, and other legal requirements from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. EPCS removes the need for paper prescriptions by allowing physicians to electronically create, sign and securely transmit such prescriptions. Pharmacies can then use EPCS&#160;to receive, review, and dispense these controlled substances. </p>
