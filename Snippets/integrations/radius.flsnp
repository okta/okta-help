        <p>Okta provides the ability for organizations to manage the authorization of and access to on-premises applications and resources using the RADIUS protocol. Okta provides a RADIUS Server agent that organizations can deploy to delegate authentication to Okta. Admins can configure sign-on policies for RADIUS-protected applications the same as other applications in the Okta Integration Network (OIN). Okta provides guides and OIN apps for several commonly-used RADIUS integrations. The generic RADIUS&#160;Application app allows admins to integrate other RADIUS-enabled apps.</p>
