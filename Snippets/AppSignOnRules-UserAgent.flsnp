        <h3>Important to know about the User-Agent</h3>
        <p>Okta’s Client Access Policies (CAPs) allow you to manage access to your enterprise apps based on the client type and device platform. Okta CAPs  evaluate information included in the <span class="wintitle">User-Agent</span> request header sent from the users’ browser. Because the User-Agent can be spoofed by a malicious actor, be aware that such actors may target the least restrictive CAP rule(s) in your policies. For this reason, make sure that your CAP rules comply with your company's security needs. Consider using an allowlist approach when you create CAPs and require MFA or Device Trust as described in the following best practices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Implement an allowlist consisting of one or more rules that specify the client type(s) + device platform(s) + trust posture combinations that will be allowed to access the app.</li>
            <li>Require Device Trust or MFA for app access.</li>
            <li>Include a final catch-all rule that denies access to anything that does not match any of the CAPs preceding rules.</li>
        </ol>
