    <body><a name="ConfigureRiskScoring"></a>Configure Risk Scoring<p>Okta's Risk Scoring capability allows you to increase the level of security that guards sign-ins to your Okta org. When enabled, the Risk Scoring engine assesses sign-in attempts against a number of criteria, including details about the device and its location. It then assigns a risk level to each Okta sign-in, which can then be used for dynamic responses according to the level of risk assessed. For example, admins might want Okta to prompt users for multifactor authentication if the sign-in is considered high-risk. It is also helpful for strengthening the security of the <a href="../../../Topics/identity-engine/authenticators/configure-okta-verify-options.htm#Number">Number Challenge</a> functionality. Admins must activate the Risk Scoring functionality and configure a sensitivity level. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Topics/Security/Security_Risk_Scoring.htm">Risk Scoring</MadCap:xref> for instructions.</p></body>
