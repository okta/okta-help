        <h1>Choose telephony provider</h1>
        <p>Choosing a telephony provider is an important decision in ensuring that your end users can securely and confidently use their phones to access your company resources. When selecting a telephony provider, consider the needs of your Okta org. For example, the number of users who use this service, how frequently, and from what geographical regions. Also, consider your budget and scalability requirements.</p>
        <p>Evaluate features, documentation, customer support, and ease of integration for each provider you’re considering. Check if they offer trials so that you can try out different vendors to determine which one of them best aligns with your requirements. Also inquire with the providers about how these features, services, and pricing may change over time.</p>
        <p>Evaluate your telephony provider based on the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Messaging features and functionality</li>
            <li>Pricing</li>
            <li>Developer experience and documentation</li>
            <li>Customer support</li>
        </ul>
