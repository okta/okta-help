        <h1>Regulatory compliance</h1>
        <p>Telephony regulations vary depending on the originating or receiving country. For example, Malaysia requires that all SMS messages sent to Malaysian phone numbers include branding information such as the company name in the message content. Similarly, Vietnam requires that all SMS messages sent to Vietnamese phone numbers from Okta mention Okta in the message content. If you use SMS messages, you must customize the SMS text sent to phone numbers in Malaysia and Vietnam to prevent the messages from being blocked.</p>
        <p>The steps for complying with regulations imposed by different countries depend on the specific regulatory requirements. For example, you can comply with the branding requirements for SMS messages by changing the default SMS text that is sent to your users. See <MadCap:xref href="../Settings/Settings_SMS.htm">Telephony Inline Hook an SMS&#160;message</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>If you customize the SMS message template,  the character set that you use may affect the maximum number of characters allowed and how the resulting messages are delivered. There are also costs incurred if a message exceeds the maximum number of characters allowed for a single message. See <MadCap:xref href="telephony-how-to-tasks.htm#Characte">Character set limitations</MadCap:xref> in <MadCap:xref href="telephony-how-to-tasks.htm#Customiz">Telephony Inline Hook SMS message templates.</MadCap:xref></p>
