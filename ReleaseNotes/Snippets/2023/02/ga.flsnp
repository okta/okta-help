		The items in this snippet come from four different places. Follow the instructions to ensure they show up in the right place:
		
		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

                <p>This version of the Okta Provisioning agent contains the migration of the Windows installer from Internet Explorer to Edge.

				The installer now requires Edge WebView2. If your machine is connected to the internet, WebView2 is downloaded automatically during the agent installation. If not, you must manually install it before installing the new agent version.

                <p>If you manage end users' personal information and passwords in an external application, you can configure that application as the <span class="uicontrol">User Identity Source</span> in <span class="wintitle">Customizations</span>. Using this setting, you can provide a link to the application in the End-User Dashboard. When end users click the link, they're taken to the third-party page to update their information and password.</p>
                <p>This setting is only applicable to the end users whose personal information and password are managed outside of Okta (for example, Active Directory). See <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Settings/settings-configure-user-account.htm">Configure user account</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>You must upgrade to Sign-in Widget version 7.3.0 or higher to use this feature. See the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget/releases">Sign-In Widget Release Notes</a>.</p>

                <p>With delegated flows, admins can be assigned the ability to run Okta Workflows directly from the Admin Console. Flows that are delegated to an admin appear on the Delegated Flows page where they can be invoked without signing in to the Workflows Console. This gives super admins more granular control over their admin assignments.

                <p>Full Featured Code Editor integrates Monaco code editing library into the Admin Console to make editing code for error pages more efficient and less reliant on documentation. Developers can write, test, and publish code faster with the better syntax highlighting, autocomplete, autosave, diff view, and a <span class="uicontrol">Revert changes</span> button.

                <p>Phishing-resistant authentication detects and prevents the disclosure of sensitive data to fake applications or websites. When users authenticate with Okta FastPass on managed devices, they’re protected from phishing attacks.

                <p>Custom app login is now available to limited customers in Identity Engine. Only orgs that actively used the feature in Classic Engine before they upgraded may continue to do so. Orgs that don't use custom app login should continue to use the Okta-hosted sign-in experience or configure IdP routing rules that redirect users to the appropriate app to sign in.

                <p>Okta now allows admins to enable user enumeration prevention for authentication or recovery flows, or both.
