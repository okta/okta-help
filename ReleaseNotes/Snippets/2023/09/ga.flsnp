		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production

                <p>With the introduction of the Chrome Device Trust Connector integration for Device Assurance, administrators can create policies that ensure compliance with specific device requirements prior to accessing resources protected by Okta. This integration between Okta and Google facilitates access policies that receive device posture signals directly from a Google API backend, eliminating the need for any agent deployment. As a result, users logging in to a ChromeOS device, or managed Chrome browser, benefit from enhanced authentication security through device security signals.</p>

                <p>With the Access Testing tool you can quickly and easily test policies and validate whether your desired security outcomes will be achieved. This tool allows you to simulate user access attributes, such as IP address, device, risk, and so on, to test whether the user will be granted access to the specified application. The tool helps you identify potential security risks and compliance issues before you implement a policy.
