            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">EMAIL_RECIPIENTS_PUBLIC_API EA 2022.5.1, doc in 2022.06.0 This was supposed to go to GA&#160;Preview in 2022.08.0, but wasn't marked for doc.

            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Product. OIE Product. OIE API. API.</p>
            <p>This API allows you to change who receives email notifications for each individual email template. You can suppress them completely, or send them to admins only. This unlocks testing scenarios which warrant using production user directories, and prevents end users from getting test emails. It also allows extensibility for customers who would like to use a third party email sender through Hooks or Workflows. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/brands/#email-template-settings">Email template settings</a>.</p>

            <p>With delegated flows, admins can be assigned the ability to run Okta Workflows directly from the Admin Console. Flows that are delegated to an admin appear on the Delegated Flows page where they can be invoked without signing in to the Workflows Console. This gives super admins more granular control over their admin assignments.
