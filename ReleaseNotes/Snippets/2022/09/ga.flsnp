		The items in this snippet come from four different places. Follow the instructions to ensure they show up in the right place:
		
		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

                <p>You can now require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) as an additional verification step for any OIDC app integration except service apps. The OAuth Security Best Current Practice recommendation is to use PKCE for all uses of the authorization code flow, regardless of the client type.

                <p>Using signed SAML requests ensures that incoming requests are from genuine applications. When this is configured, Okta only accepts SAML requests signed using the certificate associated with the app integration. Having signed SAML requests also resolves scenarios where the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL requested after authentication can be one of several domains or URLs. When a Service Provider sends a signed authentication request, Okta can accept dynamic ACS values as part of the SAML request and posts the SAML assertion response to the ACS value specified in the request. See the <span class="uicontrol">Advanced Settings</span> section of <MadCap:xref href="../../../../Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_SAML.htm">Create SAML app integrations using AIW</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <p>While you can secure access to your corporate resources with passwordless MFA using Okta FastPass, you can’t ensure the security posture of the device itself before granting access. This is especially true for unmanaged devices, where a complementary device management agent isn’t present to validate the compliance status of that device. Device Assurance policies enable you to define device security posture requirements that must be satisfied in order for a user to access a protected resource. This allows you to protect your organization's data and services by ensuring access is only granted to secure devices, even if those devices aren’t managed.

		</p>
                <p>With real-time synchronization, user profiles, groups, and group memberships can now be updated when LDAP-sourced users sign in to Okta, or when they refresh their People page. Admins no longer need to perform full or incremental imports of user attributes, and user profiles, groups, and group memberships are always up to date. Real-time synchronization also reduces the burden on system resources because user attributes are imported and updated individually and not in large groups.
