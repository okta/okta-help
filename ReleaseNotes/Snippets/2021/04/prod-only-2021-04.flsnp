            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">ENG_ENABLE_ADMIN_RESTYLE EA 2021.02.0 GA&#160;PRE 2021.03.0 GA&#160;PROD 2021.04.0 - re-GA'd 2022.04.0</p>
            <p>With the Admin Experience Redesign feature, the Okta Admin Console now has:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>A modern look and feel with improved responsiveness for the new navigation side bar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A redesigned Okta Admin Dashboard that displays more practical insights for admins.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>An Agents page in the Okta Admin Dashboard that shows the status and version of every Okta agent that is connected to customers' on-premises servers.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This improves the accessibility of the product, improves admin productivity, and helps admins to be more proactive with security issues. </p>

               FIRST_PARTY_APPS_UI, EA&#160;2020.12.0, pulld from GA&#160;PREV 2021.01.1 - Released via SUFM to Preview 2021.02.0. Note that these features are PLUGIN_OIDC and ENDUSER_OIDC FF, the FIRST_PARTY_APPS FF is a parent to them. GA&#160;PROD 2021.04.0</p>
            <p>Okta admins can now create app-based sign-on policies for the Okta Dashboard, Okta Admin Console, and Okta Browser Plugin. </p>
            <p>Previously,  sign-on policies couldn't be configured for these first party applications. With this release, policy based on context such as user location, device, behavior, risk level, group membership, and more is included. This gives admins more flexibility and granular control over sign-on requirements for these first party apps. For example, different MFA requirements might apply to the Okta Admin Console for different groups of people. </p>
