                <h3>Connector authentication enhancement</h3>
                <p>When creating a connection, the <span class="uicontrol">Base URL</span> field for authentication is now optional. If the <span class="uicontrol">Base URL</span> field is empty, the <span class="uicontrol">Authorize Path</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Token Path</span> fields need to be fully qualified URLs. However, if the <span class="uicontrol">Base URL</span> is included, those two paths only need to be relative URLs. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Workflows/connector-builder/authentication-oauth2.htm">Build authentication with OAuth 2.0</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <h3>Sidebar usability improvements</h3>
                <p>The Workflows console has been enhanced to improve usability and functionality. You can now click and drag the folder panel width to improve visibility of folder names.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Improvement to flow search history</h3>
                <p>When searching flow history, Workflows users can now access beyond the first 150 execution results. See <MadCap:xref href="../../../Workflows/execute/check-flow-history.htm">Check Flow History</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                    <p>OKTA-554084</p>
                    <p>When renaming a folder, the sidebar navigation didn't automatically sort the new folder names in case-insensitive alphabetical order.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-568558</p>
                    <p>When a flow returned multiple pages of results in the flow history, sometimes the start and finish events were on separate pages, so the execution displayed as being still in progress.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-572709</p>
                    <p>When using dynamic fields with dynamic group properties, the extensible toggle value wasn't respected. As a result, the final group definition was set to  <span class="userinput">extensible:true</span>, while other groups were set to <span class="userinput">extensible:false</span>.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>OKTA-572869</p>
                    <p>Executions in the flow history sometimes didn't include a start time and duration.</p>

                    <p>OKTA-572963</p>
                    <p>The <span class="wintitle">Delete Directory User</span> card for <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Adobe User Management" /> didn't specify that the account deleted is the directory user account, not the Adobe user account.
