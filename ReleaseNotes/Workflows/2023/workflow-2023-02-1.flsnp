                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-548430</p>
                    <p>The latency value for a flow was calculated separately for the parent and helper flows, rather than as an aggregated duration for the entire flow.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-549073</p>
                    <p>When using dynamic input or output fields, the preview card validation incorrectly indicated that having empty fields or an empty number of fields was invalid.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-552471</p>
                    <p>Sometimes connector cards and helper flows returned "null" instead of the generated text string value.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-562586</p>
                    <p>If you had a valid helper flow and you changed to a helper flow that  returned an empty output, or if the helper flow failed, then the preview output wasn't displayed correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-571394</p>
                    <p>Sometimes when a flow used the <span class="wintitle">If Error</span> card  and the flow returned an error, the Flow History showed a successful execution that changed to an error when you clicked the details.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>OKTA-577263</p>
                    <p>In the <MadCap:xref href="../../../Workflows/connector-reference/adobeusermanagement/adobeusermanagement.htm">Adobe User Management connector</MadCap:xref>, the <span class="uicontrol">Client Secret</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Private API</span> fields were displayed in plain text instead of being hidden.</p>
