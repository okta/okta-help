        <h1>Verify server enrollment</h1>
        <p>You can check if a server is enrolled in a project from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> dashboard or by running a command on a <span class="disableGlossary">client</span>.</p>
        <p>To check if a server is enrolled in a project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> dashboard.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Go to <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Resource Administration</span> <span class="uicontrol">Resource Management</span></span> and select the project where the server was enrolled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
