        <h1>On-demand users</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> creates an account when a user attempts to access a server. While the account is active, on-demand users have regular user permissions (non-administrative permissions) when using their account. After a session ends, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> server agent removes the account.</p>
        <p>On Windows servers, the associated user account and home directory are removed when the account expires. This also includes any data stored within the home directory.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">You can configure on-demand users for a project at any time by configuring the <span class="uicontrol">On Demand User TTL</span> (Time to Live) setting. See <MadCap:xref href="pam-projects.htm">Projects</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">If you enable on-demand users, you must make the server accessible through port 4421 of the previous network hop. For connections through a bastion or gateway, the server must be accessible from port 4421 of the bastion or gateway. For direct connections, the server must be accessible from port 4421 on the client. For more information, see <MadCap:xref href="server-agent/pam-configure-server-agent.htm">Configure the [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access%] server agent</MadCap:xref>.</p>
