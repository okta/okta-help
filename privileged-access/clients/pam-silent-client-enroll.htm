        <h1>Silently enroll the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> client</h1>
        <p>Silent enrollment allows you to automate the enrollment process and add multiple clients to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> at the same time. This process saves time when deploying <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> client across an organization. Many <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> teams use device management software like JAMF or SCCM to automate the process of installing  and enrolling the client. The specifics of this process will depend on the specific organizational requirements for each team.</p>
        <h2>Start the task</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> client on devices. <br />See <MadCap:xref href="../tool-setup/install-client.htm">Install the [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access%] client</MadCap:xref><br /></li>
            <li>Create an enrollment token. See <MadCap:xref href="../pam-projects.htm#Configur">Configure project settings </MadCap:xref></li>
            <li>Save the enrollment token secret to a file on the devices being enrolled.</li>
            <li>Enroll the clients by running the following command on each device:<br /><span class="code">sft fleet enroll --token-file &lt;path\to\enrollment-token.txt&gt;</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Upon success, the <span class="disableGlossary">client</span>s are enrolled with the team.</p>
