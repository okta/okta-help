        <h1>Enroll the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> client</h1>
        <p>After teams have installed the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> <span class="disableGlossary">client</span>, they must enroll the client in an existing <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> team. Enrolling the <span class="disableGlossary">client</span> adds it to the <span class="disableGlossary">client</span> inventory on the  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> platform and authorizes it to take actions. </p>
        <p>Teams can enroll clients individually or use silent enrollment to automate the enrollment process for larger groups of clients. See <MadCap:xref href="pam-silent-client-enroll.htm">Silently enroll the [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access%] client</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <h2>Start the task</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>From a command prompt on the client, run the command: <span class="code">sft enroll</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">From the browser window, select the team to enroll the <span class="disableGlossary">client</span>. <br />Note:&#160;When run in a headless environment, the command outputs a URL. Open the URL in a browser.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Click the team to enroll with, then click <span class="uicontrol">Approve</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Upon success, the <span class="disableGlossary">client</span> is enrolled with the team.</p>
