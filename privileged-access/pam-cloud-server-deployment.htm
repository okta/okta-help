        <h1>Cloud server deployments</h1>
        <p>Teams can automatically enroll cloud servers into <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> specified projects. This process is only available for Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) server instances. </p>
        <p>Automatic enrollment is the best option if a team is adding many servers from the same account or bucket into a single <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> project. Automatic enrollment isn't a good option for teams that need to manage bare metal or on-premises servers, or if specific cloud metadata is unavailable. In these situations, teams should use project enrollment tokens instead.</p>

            <p class="noteContent"><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> projects can have up to 10 attached cloud accounts.

            <p>GCP&#160;instances automatically enroll servers by using an enrollment-token. The enrollment token is either stored in a file on the instance or is contained in project metadata for the instance. </p>
