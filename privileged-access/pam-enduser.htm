        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> users can view the list of resources they have been granted access on their dashboard and connect to the resources through SSH or RDP using their Okta identity.</p>
        <p>A connect button, available on the dashboard for each server, for the user to easily connect to a server. Some servers  may require an approval request and cannot be accessed by the user until their access request is approved.</p>
