        <h1>Security administration</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> is designed to limit and control access to an org’s most privileged accounts and resources. Security administrators are responsible for ensuring appropriate controls are in place for  users who administer and use the resources protected by <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" />. </p>
        <p>With <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> the security administrator designs policies that control privileged access to resources, and the resource administrator administers those resources. The enforcement of the access policy is separated from the person who administers the resources protected by the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> solution.</p>
