        <h1>Resource administration</h1>
        <p>When you assign a user group to a Resource Administrator role, you grant them administrator privileges to access and manage the team resources. Resource administrators can create, update, or delete resource groups and assign user groups as owners of a resource group. Owners of a resource group are also called Delegated Resource Administrators. They manage projects in the context of a resource group assigned to them.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> separates the administration of resources with the control of access to those resources. The security administrator designs policies that control privileged access to resources, and the resource administrator administers those resources.</p>
