            <p class="noteContent">This beta documentation covers all the expanded capabilities that <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> offers. Some installation and reference guides, such as client and server agent guides, are identical to those referenced in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> documentation. After the beta release, these guides will be migrated to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> documentation. In the interim, you may need to use <a href="https://help.okta.com/asa/en-us/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/asa-overview.htm" target="_blank">Advanced Server Access documentation</a> to find additional information.</p>
