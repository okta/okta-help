        <h1>Resource groups</h1>
        <p>A resource group is an administrative boundary with one or more projects that the resource group owners can manage. These projects share resources and configuration options.</p>
        <p> Resource groups simplify resource management by organizing resources into groups and delegating administration to one or more user groups. A user with a resource administrator role has administrative access to all the team resources. They can create or update resource groups, and delegate the resource groups to one or more user groups. </p>
        <p>A user or a user group who is configured as the owner of a resource group is assigned the Delegated Resource Administrator role. Delegated resource administrators can create or update projects and enroll servers in projects they create for the resource group.  They can't  administer projects outside of their own resource groups.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>To perform these tasks, you must be an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> resource admin for your group. </p>
        <h2>Create a resource group</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Privileged Access" /> dashboard, go to <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Resource Administration</span><span class="uicontrol">Resource Management</span></span>. Here, you can create a resource group or update an existing one.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Create Resource Group</span>.</li>
            <li>Give a name to the resource group and add a description.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Add or modify</span> to add an owner to the resource group. You must add at least one owner to save the resource group.</li>
            <li>  In the dialog that appears, select one or more groups to add. </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The resource group is created and the project section is visible. The resource group owners can now create and manage projects.</p>
        <h2>Delete a resource group</h2>
        <p> You can't delete a resource group that contains projects.</p>
        <ol>
