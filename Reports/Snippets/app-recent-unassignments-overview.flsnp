        <p>The Recent Unassignments report contains data about who has been unassigned from a specific app integration during a specified period of time. </p>
        <p>This report also indicates the current Assignment Status of the user, because it is possible that a user has been unassigned from a specific app integration, and then reassigned to this app integration. In such a scenario, the unassignment record is present in the report although the assignment status is assigned.</p>
