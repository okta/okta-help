        <h1>Receive reports by email</h1>
        <p>The Reports Delivered by Email opt-in feature gives you an option to receive reports by email. We recommend opting in for this feature to save time, reduce the rate limit usage, and access and download reports easily.</p>
        <p>Currently, you can receive the following reports by email:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Okta Usage</li>
            <li>Okta Password Health</li>
            <li>Current Assignments</li>
            <li>MFA Usage</li>
            <li>Application Usage</li>
            <li>App Password Health</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Before you begin
        </h2>
        <p>Verify that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are signed in to your Okta org as an admin in a live session.</li>
            <li>You have the required permissions to request and view the report.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><span>Get the report by email</span>

        <ol>
            <li>In the Admin Console, go to <span class="uicontrol">Reports</span>.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Okta Usage</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Okta Password Health</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Application Usage</span>, <span class="uicontrol">App&#160;Password Health</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Current Assignments</span>, or <span class="uicontrol">MFA Usage</span>. </li>
            <li>Set the To and From dates, user, group, and parameters as required.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Run Report</span>. A confirmation message appears with the email address to which the report is sent, typically, the email address associated with your admin account.<br /><div class="noteOkta"><img src="../../Resources/Images/assets/Icons/Notes/Help.png" class="noteImgFloat" title="Note" alt="Note" /><p class="noteHeading">Note</p><p class="noteContent">If you have the new Admin Dashboard enabled, click <span class="uicontrol">Request this report</span>.</p></div></li>
            <li>Once the report is ready, you receive an email notification. If the report was successfully generated you receive an email notification with the download link to the report. If the report request failed, you will get an email notification asking you to sign in and request the report again. If you do not have permissions to view the report, you see a 403 error.
