        <h1>Log streaming</h1>
        <p>Use log streaming to easily export Okta System Log events to supported external platforms, either <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Amazon EventBridge" /> or <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Splunk Cloud" />, in near real time. You can use these platforms to:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Monitor <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> for suspicious activity.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Automate actions to mitigate risks in response to specific event types.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Raise alerts, troubleshoot issues, and perform root cause analysis.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Retain events for extended periods of time to meet compliance requirements.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note_tipOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Log streaming events, such as stream activation or deletion, are eligible for <a href="../../automation-hooks/event-hooks-main.htm">event hooks</a>. For a list of those events, see the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/">events catalog</a>.</p>

        <h3>Limitations and known issues
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Only <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> creates and maintains available integrations. ISV submissions aren't currently accepted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> sends all System Log events to a configured log stream target. No event filtering is supported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Replay functionality (resend events during a specific point in time) isn't currently supported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the log stream target stops acknowledging a log stream, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> deactivates the log stream and no events are sent to the log stream target. When the target is healthy again, you must activate the log stream from the log streaming page in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Admin Console.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Event delivery: Delivery of events is best effort. Events are delivered at least once to an active log stream. Sometimes events may arrive out of order and an event may be sent multiple times. To establish ordering, you can use the time stamp contained in the <span class="codeph">data.events.published</span> property of each event. To detect duplicate event delivery,  compare the <span class="codeph">eventId</span> value of incoming events with the values of previously received events.</p>
                <p>If the log stream responds to a delivery event with an error or if it times out, the delivery attempt fails. Okta retries delivery when either happens. Only two delivery attempts are made without any additional wait time between retries before deactivating the log stream. You can view the <span class="codeph">system.log_stream.lifecycle.deactivate</span> event in the System Log user interface or using the System Log API. The stream state indicates that it's deactivated in the log stream configuration.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Event latency: <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> doesn't guarantee a maximum duration between the occurrence of an event and the delivery to a log stream. In addition, where a third-party service is specified as the log stream, the third-party service may insert a delay that is outside of <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />’s control. If <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> hasn't reported an issue but events associated with an active stream don't appear in the specified third-party service, contact that service's support organization.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Stream targets that receive logs are Non- <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Applications. Non-<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Applications include web-based, offline, mobile, or other applications that are provided by you or a third party and interoperate with the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Service.</p>
                <div class="noteOkta">
                    <p class="noteContent"> Send logs to Non-<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Applications only if you're authorized on behalf of your organization to do so. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> can't guarantee continued partnerships or functionality with any Non-<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Applications.</p>
