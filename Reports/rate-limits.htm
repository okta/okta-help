        <h1>Rate Limits report</h1>
        <p>This report queries the System Log to provide charts of cumulative rate-limit violations over selected time periods, as well a list of current rate limits by API, which includes any recent violations or warnings with per minute usage trends looking back seven days. You can also adjust rate-limit settings, such as client-based rate limits customized warning thresholds, on a separate tab.
