        <h1>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Policy Framework</h1>
        <p>Okta provides several types of policies. Each type is used to control a different aspect of the authentication flow. Policies work with groups and network zones to respond dynamically to any type of authentication scenario to safeguard access to Okta and your apps.</p>
        <p>To achieve the overall goal of securing access to your org and apps, you need to configure each type of policy to address each part of the authentication process. You don't use one type of policy in isolation, you use all of them together to secure the entire authentication flow. When you create policies, you're creating the rules for accessing your Okta org or apps, and enrolling in MFA. Okta then enforces these rules when a user attempts to sign in to Okta or access an app.</p>
        <p>This topic describes each policy type and how to use them all together to help secure access to your org and apps in a Zero Trust architecture. To learn how to set up a Zero Trust architecture, see <MadCap:xref href="set-up-zero-trust-architecture.htm">Set up a Zero Trust architecture</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Policies</h2>
        <p>Policies control, among other things, user session lifetime, whether multifactor authentication is required when logging in, which multifactor authentication methods may be employed, password complexity requirements, which types of self-service operations are permitted under various circumstances, and what Identity Provider to route users to. Policies generally consist of large elements that can be applied to many users, such as a minimum password length. Here are the policies available in Okta:</p>
        <div MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.Classic">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Password policy</span>: This policy sets the password requirements, such as password strength, for Okta or Active Directory-mastered users.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle"><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> sign-on policy</span>: This policycontrols access to your Okta org. You can determine which factors users must authenticate with, set rules to block or deny access to Okta, and set the session lifetime.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">App sign-on policy</span>: This policy controls access to the apps in your environment. You can restrict access to specific user groups, set the re-authentication frequency, and allow or deny access based on location, risk level, and Device Trust status.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Multifactor (MFA) policy</span>: This policy  controls how and when users must enroll in your required authentication factors.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.OIE">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Global session policy</span>: This policy  controls access to your Okta org. You can determine which authenticators  users must authenticate with, block or deny access to Okta, and set the session lifetime.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Authentication policy</span>:  This policy controls access to the apps in your environment. You can restrict access to specific user groups, set the re-authentication frequency, and allow or deny access based on location, risk level, and Device Trust status.</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Authenticator enrollment policy</span>: This policy controls how and when users must enroll in your required authenticators.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>Policies have rules applied to them, which determine whether they're applicable to a particular user at a particular time.  Rules, like policies, contain conditions that must be satisfied for the rule to be applied. They consist of conditions such as place and circumstance, like geographical location or whether the user is on or off a company network. Rules instruct Okta on what action to take in response to user or sign-in conditions. </p>
        <p>Each policy includes a default rule. Okta recommends that you don't change the default rule. Instead, create your own custom rules in addition to the default rule. This default rule functions as a catch-all rule that's evaluated when the condition of all other rules in the policy aren't met.</p>
        <p>You can create rules for each group of users in your environment and require each group to pass different authentication challenges, depending on their job function, sign-in location, or another factor. For example, you might want to require extra verification for users who attempt to access sensitive apps from outside your organization's network.</p>
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Okta evaluates  each policy in the order in which they appear in the Admin Console, starting with the policy at the top. Similarly, Okta executes each rule inside each policy in the order in which they appear, also starting at the top. </p>
        <p>You can drag policies and rules  into the order in which you want Okta to process them. Okta recommends that you place your more restrictive policies or rules at the top of the list and your less restrictive ones at the bottom. Okta also recommends that you leave the default policy or rule as the last (lowest) item in the list.</p>
        <p>Okta checks each policy in the list until it finds one that satisfies the requirements of the rules inside it. If you keep the default policy or rule at the bottom of the list, Okta only executes it when none of the other policies or rules above it can be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>When Okta finds a policy or rule that can be fulfilled, it stops processing further policies and rules and carries out the instructions in the policy or rule that meets the conditions.</p>
