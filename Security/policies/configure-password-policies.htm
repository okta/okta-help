      <h1>
         <a name="Configur"/>Configure a password policy</h1>
      <p>Password policies enable admins to define password policies and associated rules that enforce password settings at the group and authentication-provider level. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> provides a default policy to enforce the use of strong passwords to better protect your organization's assets. Admins can also create additional policies that are less or more restrictive and apply them to users based on group membership.</p>
      <p>Password reset requests made by Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)-sourced users can fail when a password policy on an LDAP server doesn’t allow users to change their password. If a password reset fails, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.LDAP agent"/> log provides the LDAP error code. To create password policies that allow users to change their password, consult the LDAP server manual provided by the vendor.</p>
      <p>When an admin creates a temporary password for LDAP sourced users, users must change their password when they next sign-in if the LDAP server password policy requires or allows it. To create password policies that support temporary passwords, consult the LDAP server manual provided by the vendor.</p>

         <h3>AD / LDAP Softlock</h3>
         <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> can help prevent AD and LDAP-sourced users from getting locked out of their Windows account and hardware device due to too many failed <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> sign-in attempts. This feature also helps prevent a malicious third party from using <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> to lock out users.</p>
         <p>To prevent Active Directory and LDAP lockouts, make sure that the number entered for <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Lock out user after &lt;#</span>
               <span class="uicontrol">unsuccessful attempts</span>
            </span> is lower than the failed sign-in attempt limit configured in AD and LDAP. For example, if the maximum number of failed Windows sign-in attempts is set to 10 in AD and LDAP, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> recommends setting your maximum <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> failed sign-in limit to 9. If a user exceeds the sign-in limit set in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>, additional failed attempts aren't sent to AD or LDAP. This prevents users from locking themselves out of their Windows account. In AD, locked out <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> users can use self-service account unlock or seek help from an <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> admin. Only admins can unlocked LDAP-sourced accounts.</p>

         </p>
         <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> also prevents <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>-sourced users from getting locked out of their <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> accounts as a result of too many failed <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> sign-in attempts. This feature adds the ability to block suspicious sign-in attempts from unknown devices. </p>
         <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> can detect whether sign-in attempts are coming from a known or unknown device. A known device is one that has been previously used to sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>. An unknown device has never been used to sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>.</p>
         <p>If <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> determines that the failed sign-in attempts are coming from an unknown device, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> locks out new sign-in attempts from unknown devices, but allows sign-ins from known devices.  This helps prevent malicious parties from disrupting <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> users' access to their accounts and enhances account protection.</p>
         <p>The minimum lockout duration for lockouts triggered by unknown devices is two hours. If a legitimate user needs to sign in from a new device during this time, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> initiates the self-service account unlock flow (if the org admin has enabled it). When the user unlocks the account, they'll be allowed to sign in from the new device. </p>
         <p>Admins don't need to configure any settings to activate this feature.</p>
         <h3>
            <a name="knownlimitations"/>Known limitations</h3>
         <p>Admins don't see locked out user accounts on the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard"/> that are caused by an unknown device,  and they can't unlock these accounts. To enable users who lost a device and have a new one, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> recommends that admins enable the self-service account unlock functionality so these users don't have to wait for the lockout duration to expire before they can access their account. See <a href="#selfservrecopts">Self-service recovery options</a>.</p>

         <h3>AD / LDAP Softlock</h3>
         <p>
            <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> can help prevent AD and LDAP-sourced users from getting locked out of their Windows account and hardware device due to too many failed <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> sign-in attempts. This feature also helps prevent a malicious third party from using <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> to lock out users.</p>
         <p>To prevent Active Directory and LDAP lockouts, make sure that the number entered for <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Lock out user after &lt;#</span>
               <span class="uicontrol">unsuccessful attempts</span>
            </span> is lower than the failed sign-in attempt limit configured in AD and LDAP. For example, if the maximum number of failed Windows sign-in attempts is set to 10 in AD and LDAP, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> recommends setting your maximum <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> failed sign-in limit to 9. If a user exceeds the sign-in limit set in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>, additional failed attempts aren't sent to AD or LDAP. This prevents users from locking themselves out of their Windows account. In AD, locked out <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> users can use self-service account unlock or seek help from an <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> admin. Only an admin can unlock LDAP-sourced accounts.</p>
