        <h1>Configure an MFA&#160;enrollment policy</h1>
        <p>Multifactor enrollment (MFA) enrollment policies determine when users enroll in MFA and which factors they enroll in. </p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">If your org doesn't require group-based factors, it isn't necessary to create additional policies. You can retain the <span class="uicontrol">Default Policy</span> instead.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Create an MFA&#160;enrollment policy</h2>

            <li><span class="uicontrol">Exclude Users</span>: If needed, you can exclude individual users of a group from the rule.</li>
            <li>Under <span class="uicontrol">AND User is accessing</span>, select <span class="uicontrol">Applications</span>.<ul><li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Any application</span> to apply this rule to all applications that can be accessed by the end user.

            <li><span class="uicontrol">Manage configuration for Network</span>: Click the <span class="uicontrol">Manage Configurations for Network</span> link to access your gateway settings that enable your choice of access.

        <ul>
