        <h1>Improved New Device Behavior Detection</h1>
        <p>The Improved New Device Behavior Detection feature is a mechanism for detecting that a user is signing in from a new device.</p>
        <p>For example, when a user receives a new laptop from their organization and signs in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> from it, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> recognizes that this device hasn't been used to sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> before, and registers this device as new.</p>
        <p>This feature analyzes data from HTTP cookies from the browser through which the user signed in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> and trusted applications to provide data about the new device. Policies evaluate these data to determine whether the user must be prompted for multifactor authentication (MFA) or be allowed to sign in without MFA.</p>
        <p>To enable this feature, contact your account representative. </p>
        <p>See <MadCap:xref href="../proc-security-behavior-detection.htm">Behavior Detection and evaluation</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Known limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sign-in activity from a device using a browser without an HTTP cookie is treated as a new device, but with limited accuracy.</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> doesn't use data from the Improved New Device Behavior Detection feature to determine when to send an email notification for a new sign-in. In addition, changes to <span class="code">deviceToken</span> or browser cookies may not trigger a new sign-on email notification. See <MadCap:xref href="../Security_General.htm#New">New sign-on notification emails</MadCap:xref> in <MadCap:xref href="../Security_General.htm">General Security</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../healthinsight/notifications-signon.htm">Sign-on notifications for end users</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Trusted applications</h2>
        <p>Trusted applications are responsible for identifying devices as part of new device detection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can send a unique identifier for each device using <span class="code">deviceToken</span> in the context object. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#context-object" target="_blank">Authentication context object</a>. <ul><li>Sign-in activity is identified as coming from a new device when a trusted application doesn't send the unique identifier.</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <p>If Improved New Device Behavior Detection isn't enabled for your org, you can send a unique identifier for each device using the <span class="code">X-DEVICE-FINGERPRINT</span> header. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#primary-authentication-with-device-fingerprinting" target="_blank">Primary authentication with device fingerprinting</a>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To learn how to generate a unique identifier, see <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#device-fingerprint-best-practices" target="_blank">Device fingerprint best practices</a>.</p>
        <h3>Note about device detection</h3>
        <p>In the past, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />  used JavaScript fingerprinting to identify new devices.  The Improved New Device Behavior Detection feature no longer relies on browser fingerprinting (not the use of physical fingerprints in biometric authentication):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser support for browser fingerprinting only provides best-effort accuracy because some browser vendors may reduce fingerprinting accuracy.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The browser fingerprint may change over time as the same browser fingerprint may be sent from multiple devices. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a result, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> recommends enabling Improved New Device Behavior Detection  for more accurate detection.</p>
