        <h1>Custom admin roles</h1>
        <p>Custom admin roles gives you the ability to configure granular permissions within a role. This feature offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>More control over creation of roles in a self-service way. You can create custom role assignments based on your specific use case.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Increased org security. You can assign granular permissions to your admins and apps in a way that only gives them permissions that they need to perform a task. This reduces the need to assign the super admin and org admin roles to your users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Simplified admin audits and compliance review with more visibility over granular admin permissions</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An admin role assignment consists of these three components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;">Admin - the user, user group, or app that you need to grant admin permissions to.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;">Role - A set of permissions that you constrain an admin to. There are two types of roles, standard and custom. You can create a maximum of 100 roles for an org. Currently, permissions are limited to managing user, group, and app activity, and running profile source imports.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p style="font-weight: normal;">Resource set - A collection of resources. You can create a maximum of 10,000 resource sets and assign a maximum of 1,000 resources for each resource set. Currently, only user groups and apps in your org are considered as resources.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/assets/Icons/Notes/Help.png" class="noteImgFloat" title="Note" alt="Note" />
            <ul>
                <li>Resource sets are only available for custom admin roles.</li>
                <li>You can only have 1,000 admins who have the same role and resource set combination constrained to them.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You have the flexibility to create or select any one of these components as a starting point for creating a custom admin role assignment. Before creating an admin role assignment, Okta recommend that you see <MadCap:xref href="best-practices-custom-admin-roles.htm">Best practices for creating a custom role assignment</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>For a video tutorial, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UvPGpL3fL8&amp;ab_channel=Okta" target="_blank">Demonstrating Delegated Administration with Okta Custom Admin Roles</a>.</p>
        <h3>Impact on Standard roles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Your pre-existing roles (super admin, org admin, group admin, app admin, read-only admin, mobile admin, help desk admin, report admin, API access management admin, and group membership admin) are referred to <MadCap:xref href="use-standard-roles.htm"><a href="use-standard-roles.htm">standard roles</a></MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can continue using the pre-existing roles and your existing assignments remain the same</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can also assign custom roles to users who have standard roles assigned.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limitations </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Group and user resources for AD/LDAP groups don't include the group origin. If multiple groups have the same name, there is no way to distinguish them from one another in the UI.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Admins who are only assigned custom admin roles can’t manage a user with a super admin assignment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can only get the admin reports from the Admin role assignment reports page in the Admin Console. Currently, getting reports using an APIisn't supported.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
