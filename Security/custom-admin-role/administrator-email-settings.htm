      <h1>
         <a name="top"/>Configure email notifications for an admin role</h1>
      <p>Super admins can set default email notifications for all admins in their org. Most admins have their own set of available <MadCap:xref href="#Notifica">Email notifications</MadCap:xref>. The exceptions are report, group membership, and third-party admins, who may receive global Okta communications but aren't eligible for system notifications.</p>
      <p>After you configure these settings, admins will only receive emails for groups, apps, or users that they have permission to view. For example, an app admin who is subscribed to app-related email notifications only receives notifications about the apps they're constrained to.</p>
      <h2>Before you begin</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Ensure that you're signed in as a super admin.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Start this task</h2>

            <p>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Roles</span> tab.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Locate the role that you want to configure email notifications for and select <span class="menucascade">
                  <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>
                  <span class="uicontrol">Edit role notifications</span>

         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Select the email notifications that the role should have.</p>
         </li>
         <li>

      <p>Notes:
        </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Individual admins can set their own email notification preferences. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Settings/settings-configure-your-notifications.htm">Admin email notifications</MadCap:xref>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>When you edit an admin type's email notifications, any custom notification preferences that individual admins  configure are restored to their type defaults (this occurs regardless of the admin type that you edited).</li>
         <li>
            <p>Rate limit warning and violation: All admins receive notification banners in the Admin Console and emails about their org-wide rate limit usage. Notifications flag warnings and violations. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rate-limits/">Rate limits overview</a> to better understand rate limits and <MadCap:xref href="../../Settings/set-up-rate-limit-notifs.htm">Set up rate limit notifications </MadCap:xref> for instructions on enabling rate limit notifications.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Admins with more than one role receive all of the email notification types selected for each of their assigned roles.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Super admins for all <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Customer Identity"/> orgs are only notified in the Admin Console and by email about their org-wide rate limit usage and not for their client and operations-based rate limit usage. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rate-limits/">Rate limits overview</a>. </p>
         </li>
