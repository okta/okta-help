        <h1>Permission conditions</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/ea-featmgr.flsnp" />
        <p>To better meet your org's security needs, you can modify the view and edit profile attributes permissions in a custom admin role by adding conditions. </p>
        <p>When you expand the <span class="uicontrol">Add conditions</span> section for the <span class="uicontrol">View users and their details</span> and  <span class="uicontrol">Edit users' profile attributes</span> permissions, <span class="uicontrol">Operator</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Attribute</span> fields appear. You can use the <span class="uicontrol">Attribute</span> field to select one or more profile attributes. The <span class="uicontrol">Operator</span> field allows you to include or exclude those attributes from the role.</p>
        <p>There are several important things to note when using permission conditions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Admins with conditioned permissions can't run imports or preview mappings in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Profile Editor" />. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can't restrict admins from viewing the <span class="uicontrol">First name</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Last name</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Username</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Primary email</span>, or <span class="uicontrol">Mobile phone</span> attributes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Excluded attributes can still be viewed in SAML-based API responses. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Admins can only search using the profile attributes they have access to. If they're assigned one role that includes an attribute and another role that excludes it, the attribute is granted to the admin.</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>For an admin to search for a user by profile attribute, they must be able to access that attribute on all users in the org.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you disable the functionality, your configured permission conditions are removed.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
