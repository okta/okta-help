        <h1>Work with the admin component</h1>
        <p>As a super admin, you can assign admin permissions to other users <MadCap:change MadCap:changes="1">and apps </MadCap:change>so they're able to perform tasks and access resources. You can assign standard roles to an admin, or create custom roles that limit an admin’s access to a subset of permissions and resources.</p>
        <p>Users and groups with assigned admin roles have access to the Admin Console. They also have access to the permissions resources that are included in the assignment. </p>
        <h2>Assign admin roles to users and groups</h2>
        <p>You can assign admin roles to individual users or to groups of users. When you assign admin roles to a group, each of the admins in that group are assigned the role.</p>
        <p>You can view the users and groups with  assigned admin roles by selecting the <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Administrators</span><span class="uicontrol">Admin</span></span> tab, and then selecting <span class="uicontrol">Users</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Groups</span>. You can also view admin role assignments in <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">People</span><span class="uicontrol">Admin roles</span></span> and in <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Groups</span><span class="uicontrol">Admin roles</span></span>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Assign_admin_roles_to_apps"></a>Assign admin roles to apps</h2>
        <p>You can assign admin roles to your org’s custom API&#160;Service Integrations. </p>
        <p>You can view the apps with assigned admin roles by selecting the <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Administrators</span><span class="uicontrol">Admin</span></span> tab, and then selecting <span class="uicontrol">Apps</span>. You can also view admin role assignments in <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Applications</span><span class="uicontrol">Admin roles</span></span>.</p>

        <h2>Third-party administrators</h2>
        <p>Third-party admins perform some administrative actions, but they can’t do any of the following things. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Receive Okta admin email notifications</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Contact Okta Support</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sign in to the Okta Help Center</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Third-party admin scenarios</h3>
        <p>Some organizations  need to set up administrator roles in Okta for individuals who perform admin functions but aren't direct employees of their organization. The parent organization may even create a custom portal for administrator functions, so that third-party admins don't even see the Okta interface.</p>
        <p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An org's support team outsources its services to a third party. This third party manages user needs on behalf of the org but doesn't actually see the Okta user interface.</li>
            <li>An&#160;org uses a business to business to consumer (B2B2C) model. A "hub-and-spoke" is set up with end customers (external users) created as admins so they can run their own Okta org. The org may offer a  custom portal created with Okta APIs so these external users aren’t aware that they're admins in Okta.  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the external users in these scenarios  are given traditional admin roles in Okta, they'll receive default <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> admin emails like customer notifications, admin email alerts, and welcome messages. By giving these users third-party admin permissions, you can prevent them from receiving Okta admin email notifications, or from contacting Okta support.</p>
