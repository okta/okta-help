        <h1>Use standard roles</h1>
        <p>Okta provides several standard admin roles with pre-selected permission and resource assignments. These roles help you delegate common tasks to the admins in your org. 
          Okta recommends that you choose the admin component as a starting point to create a standard admin role assignment.</p>
        <p>To use standard roles from the <span class="wintitle">Administrators</span> page:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/task steps/Security_Administrators.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="p_3">Go to the <span class="uicontrol">Roles</span> tab. The <span class="wintitle">Roles</span> tab displays a list of previously created standard and custom roles. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="p_3">Filter by the <span class="uicontrol">Standard role</span> type. You can assign both custom and standard role types to your users, user groups, and apps. The permissions of each assigned role are additive. <br /></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_3">To manage the standard roles that are assigned to a user, group, or app, go to the respective profile and select the <span class="uicontrol">Admin roles</span> tab. </p>
        <p>You can constrain the group admin, help desk  admin, and group membership roles to everyone or a subset of groups. You can constrain an app admin to all apps, app types, and app instances.</p>
