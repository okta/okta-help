				<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> collects <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta ThreatInsight" /> data for aggregation purposes even if this option is selected.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Log authentication attempts from malicious IPs</span>: ThreatInsight records information about sign-in attempts from potentially malicious IP addresses in the System Log.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Log and enforce security based on threat level</span>: ThreatInsight can limit or block authentication requests from suspicious IP addresses based on the threat level detected. For example, if a specific IP address is suspected of malicious activity but the threat level is considered low, authentication requests from the IP address aren't denied access but might be subjected to a rate limit. The rate limit helps ensure that requests from a suspicious IP address don't overload authentication services and affect legitimate traffic. With the option to limit access requests from suspicious IP addresses, ThreatInsight can reduce the risk of malicious activity without blocking access for legitimate users. However, if an IP address is suspected of malicious activity and the threat level detected is high, authentication requests from the IP address are blocked.</li></ul></li>
