        <h1><MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />)</h1>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor lets you use a biometric method, such as fingerprint reading, to authenticate. This factor supports three authentication methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Security keys, such as <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> or Google Titan.</li>
            <li>Platform authentication that's integrated into a device and uses biometric data, such as Windows Hello or Apple <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Touch ID&#160;(Apple)" />.</li>
            <li>Sign-ins to URLs that are different from the org's <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> URL, custom domain URL, trusted cross-origin, or cross-Relying Party Identifier, require validation when using the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/trusted-origins/">Trusted Origins API</a>. See <MadCap:xref href="API-trusted-origins.htm">Configure Trusted Origins</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) follows the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/fido2-web-authentication-webauthn/" target="_blank">FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard</a>. After this factor is enabled, end users can select it when signing in and use it for additional authentication.</p>
        <p>To set up and manage YubiKeys to use the one-time password (OTP) mode, see <MadCap:xref href="mfa/yubikey.htm">[%=3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name%] (MFA)</MadCap:xref>.

            <li>Each user can configure a maximum of 10 <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" /> enrollments.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="End User Experience"></a>User experience</h2>
        <p>If this factor is enabled, users can select it when signing in and set it up so it can be used for additional authentication. Depending on your configuration, users may also be required to provide User Verification. This verification can include a biometric challenge, PIN, or password in addition to tapping the device.</p>
        <p>When enrolling a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" /> Security Key or Biometric factor, users are prompted to allow <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to have information about that particular enrolled factor. This allows each <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor to appear by name in the <span class="wintitle">Extra Verification</span> section of the user's <span class="wintitle">Settings</span> page.</p>
        <p>If a user is only enrolled in the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor, they risk being unable to authenticate into their account if something goes wrong with their <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor or device. To ensure that users can always access their <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> account if one of their devices malfunctions, is lost, or stolen, encourage users to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up other MFA factors, in addition to <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />), that aren't bound to a particular device.</li>
            <li>Create multiple <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" /> enrollments in multiple browsers and on multiple devices. </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent"><MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor enrollments, such as <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Touch ID&#160;(Apple)" />, are attached to a single browser profile on a single device. </p>
            <p class="noteContent">If users want to use a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor on multiple browsers or devices, advise them that they must create a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) enrollment in each browser, and on each device, in which they want to use the factor.       </p>
            <p class="noteContent">For example, if a user has <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.GOOG-Chrome-long" /> and <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.MozillaFF-long" /> browsers on a Microsoft Windows computer, and <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.GOOG-Chrome-long" /> and <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.APPL-Safari-long" /> browsers on an Apple Macintosh computer, they must create a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" /> enrollment in each of those four browsers.</p>
            <p class="noteContent">If they have multiple Google account profiles in the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.GOOG-Chrome-long" /> browser, they must also create a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" /> enrollment for each of those Google account profiles.</p>
            <p class="noteContent">In addition, if you enable the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor on your *.okta.com URL, the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor only allows access to your org using your *.okta.com URL. If you enable the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor using the custom URL for your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> org, the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor only allows access to your org through that custom URL. To allow your users to access your org through both URLs, you must enable the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) factor in both URLs.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Passkey Management</h2>
        <p>Passkeys are an implementation of the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> standard in which the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) credential may exist on multiple devices, such as on phones, tablets, or laptops, and across multiple operating system platforms. Passkeys enable <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) credentials to be backed up and synchronized across devices. This preserves the strong key-based/non-phishable authentication model of <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) while trading off some enterprise security features, such as device-bound keys and attestations, that are available today with some (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) authenticators. Users no longer need to carry their security key or phone to pass multifactor authentication challenges. Instead, they can use any device they have already enrolled to authenticate themselves because their credential isn't confined to a single device.</p>
        <p>In managed-device environments, users may be able to enroll unmanaged devices to a passkey credential and use such devices to gain access to corporate systems. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> allows admins to block the use of passkeys for new <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2" /> (<MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />) enrollments for their entire org. When this feature is turned on, users can't enroll new, unmanaged devices using pre-registered passkeys. Admins can ensure that security policies are enforced on managed devices and address the risk of unmanaged and potentially compromised devices accessing corporate systems.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">When you turn this feature on, that is, block the use of passkeys in your org, users running macOS&#160;Monterrey can't enroll in <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Touch ID&#160;(Apple)" /> using the Safari browser.</p>
