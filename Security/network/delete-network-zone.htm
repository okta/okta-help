        <h1>Delete a network zone</h1>
        <p>When you delete an IP zone or dynamic zone, all rules that use the deleted zone are affected.</p>
        <h2>Before you Begin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If the network zone to delete is the only zone in any rule, you can't delete the zone and you receive an error message. Edit the rule to use a different zone, then attempt to delete the network zone again. </li>
            <li>If the network zone to delete isn't the only zone in any rule you can delete the zone. The zone is removed from all the rules where it's specified.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.OIE">If the network zone that you want to delete is active and is used by other rules, including rules in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> for customers who upgraded to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, make the network zone inactive before you attempt to delete it.</li>
