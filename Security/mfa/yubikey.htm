        <h1><MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> (MFA)</h1><a name="YubiKey"></a>
        <p>A <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name"></MadCap:variable> is a brand of security key used as a physical multifactor authentication device. To use it, the user inserts the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name"></MadCap:variable> into a USB&#160;port on their computer when they're signing in and taps the YubiKey's button when prompted. The <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name"></MadCap:variable> may provide a one-time password (OTP) or perform fingerprint (biometric) verification, depending on the type of <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name"></MadCap:variable> the user presents. </p>
        <p> This topic provides instructions for setting up and managing YubiKeys using the OTP mode. To use YubiKeys for biometric verification, see <MadCap:xref href="../mfa-webauthn.htm">[%=3rd Party Integrations.FIDO2%] ([%=3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn%])</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>To use this multifactor authentication (MFA) factor, generate a .csv file of the YubiKeys that you import using a tool from YubiKey's maker, Yubico. Then, activate the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> factor and import the .csv file. Users activate their YubiKeys the next time they sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</p>

        <h2><a name="Before_you_begin"></a>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>Before you can enable the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> factor, you need to configure the YubiKeys and generate a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> OTP secrets file (also known as the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> Seed File) using the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey Personalization Tool" />. The <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> OTP secrets file is a .csv that you upload into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to activate the YubiKeys. See <a href="https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006460-programming-yubikeys-for-okta-adaptive-multi-factor-authentication" target="_blank">Programming YubiKeys for Okta Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication</a> for instructions. When you have finished generating the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> OTP secrets file, save it to a secure location.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Don't create a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> OTP secrets file manually. Only the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> Personalization Tool can populate the public and private key information for each <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" />. If this information is missing, the YubiKeys may not work properly.</p>
        </div>
        <p>After you've configured the YubiKeys and uploaded the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> OTP secrets file to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, you can distribute the YubiKeys to your end users.</p>
        <h2>Create a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> configuration file</h2>
        <p>Before you can enable the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> integration as a multifactor authentication option, you need to obtain and upload a Configuration Secrets file generated through the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> Personalization Tool. Find details on generating this file (which might also be called a <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> or <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> secrets file) from <a href="https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006460-programming-yubikeys-for-okta-adaptive-multi-factor-authentication" target="_blank">Programming YubiKeys for <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication</a>. </p>
        <p>The Configuration Secrets file is a .csv that allows you to provide authorized <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> to your org's end users. Yubico sends the requested number of "clean" hard tokens that you can distribute to your end users.</p>
        <p>Be sure to read and follow the instructions found in <span class="wintitle">Programming <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> for <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication</span> carefully. Once completed, follow the steps under <span class="wintitle">Uploading into the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Platform</span> found in <span class="wintitle">Using <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name"></MadCap:variable> Authentication in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable></span>.</p>
        <h3>Troubleshoot the Configuration Secrets file</h3>
        <p>If you encounter problems with generating your Configuration Secrets file or in configuring your YubiKeys, verify that you've completed the following tasks.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Select Configuration Slot 1</span>. Each <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name" /> is configured for the YubiCloud in Configuration Slot 1 by default. If you plan to use your YubiKeys for services other than <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, you can use Slot 2 for <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> configuration. However, if you’re experiencing errors, it’s a best practice to use Configuration Slot 1 exclusively for <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</p>
