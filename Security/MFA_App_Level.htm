        <h1>App-level multifactor authentication</h1>
        <p>You can configure multifactor authentication (MFA) at the application level. This provides an extra layer of security for the apps that you specify. Users must re-authenticate with the factors you configure to access the app.</p>
        <p>You can configure app-level MFA, org-level MFA, or both. If you configure both, users must authenticate when they sign into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> and again when they sign into apps that you've configured for app-level MFA.</p>
        <p>Refer to <MadCap:xref href="mfa/mfa-home.htm">Multifactor Authentication</MadCap:xref> for information on org-level MFA.</p>
