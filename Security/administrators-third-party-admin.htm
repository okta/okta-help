        <h1>Third-party administrators</h1>
        <p>Third-party admins perform some administrative actions, but they can’t:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Receive Okta admin email notifications</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Contact Okta Support</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Log into the Okta Help Center</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Third-party admin scenarios</h2>
        <p>Some organizations  need to set up administrator roles in Okta for individuals who perform admin functions but are not direct employees of their organization. The parent organization may even create a custom portal for administrator functions, so that third-party admins do not even see the Okta interface.</p>
        <p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An org's support team outsources its services to a third party. This third party manages user needs on behalf of the org but does not actually see the Okta user interface.</li>
            <li>An&#160;org uses a Business to Business to Consumer (B2B2C) model. A "hub-and-spoke" is set up with end customers (external users) created as admins so they can run their own Okta org. The org may offer a  custom portal created with Okta APIs so these external users aren’t aware that they are admins in Okta.  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the external users in these scenarios  are given traditional admin roles in Okta, they will receive default <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> admin emails like customer notifications, admin email alerts, and welcome messages. By giving these users third-party admin permissions, you can prevent them from receiving Okta admin email notifications, or from contacting Okta support.</p>
