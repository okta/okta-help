        <h1>Okta solutions for phishing resistance</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> phishing resistance can protect your organization from  identity-based attacks. </p>
        <p>The traditional authentication model of username and password doesn't provide security against advanced phishing techniques. More secure factors like SMS, push, and one-time passwords are also at risk, because they rely on a user's ability to detect the phishing attempt.</p>
        <p>Despite the prevalence and frequency of identity-based attacks, many organizations are slow to implement phishing-resistant authentication methods. You might view phishing-resistant methods as difficult to deploy or hard for your  users to adopt, but many of the solutions are already available in your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> org today. </p>
        <h2> Identity-based attacks</h2>
        <p>In an identity-based attack, bad actors phish a user's credentials and access  their applications and resources. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Credential stuffing is an attack in which the stolen credentials from one organization are used to access another organization.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Email, phone, and SMS phishing messages usually contain a URL that points to a fake sign-in page where attackers can capture user credentials.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bots can intercept temporary one-time passwords and use them with stolen credentials. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Man-in-the-middle attackers can intercept client requests and forward them to another server, capturing credentials and session cookies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>MFA&#160;push fatigue is an attack in which many push notifications are sent to a user's authentication app.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>OAuth consent phishing is an attack in which users who are already signed in to an app are tricked into granting access to their data.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Identity-based attacks are different from endpoint attacks, in which malware or ransomware compromises a device or browser, or a network is hijacked. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> doesn't protect against endpoint attacks.</p>

        <h3>Prepare your org</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Classify your apps by the level of security required.&#160; </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Low-security apps:&#160;These apps don't have sensitive information and don't require privileged user permissions. Unauthorized access or disclosure of information would have minimal impact.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Medium-security apps:&#160;Unauthorized access or disclosure of information would have serious effects.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>High-security apps:&#160;Unauthorized access or disclosure of information would be catastrophic.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ensure that all end users in your org are in correct groups and that admins are grouped by permission. See <MadCap:xref href="../../users-groups-profiles/usgp-groups-main.htm">Manage groups</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Notify users of the upcoming phishing-resistant requirements. See  the <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/end-user-adoption-toolkit" target="_blank">End User Adoption Toolkit</a> for communication templates.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Implement phishing resistance</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Enable and set up phishing-resistant authenticators. First, set up <a href="../../identity-engine/authenticators/configure-webauthn.htm">WebAuthn (FIDO 2)</a> and <a href="../../identity-engine/authenticators/configure-okta-verify.htm">Okta Verify</a>. Then, <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/devices/fp/fp-configure.htm">Configure Okta FastPass</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Configure authenticator enrollment policies for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> and <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.WebAuthn" />. See <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/policies/create-mfa-policy.htm">Create an authenticator enrollment policy</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Configure phishing-resistant authentication policies for low, medium, and high-security apps. Select phishing-resistant authenticators where possible. See <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/policies/create-auth-policy.htm">Create an [%=okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy%]</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/policies/add-app-sign-on-policy-rule.htm">Add an [%=okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy%] rule</MadCap:xref>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Assign apps to the phishing-resistant policies based on your security classification. See <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/policies/share-auth-policies.htm">Add apps to an authentication policy</MadCap:xref>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Provide phishing resistance for new users the first time they access your apps. See <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/authenticators/onboard-with-preenrolled-yubikey.htm">Onboard users with pre-enrolled [%=3rd Party Integrations.YubiKey company name%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For the detailed procedure and user experience, see <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/authenticators/phishing-resistant-auth.htm">Phishing-resistant authentication</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Monitor your org</h3>
        <p>After you've rolled out phishing resistance, monitor your applications and authenticators. Refine your authentication policies if needed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Monitor the System Log for phishing-resistant sign-in events. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Reports/syslog-filters.htm">System Log filters and search</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Establish communication channels where users can submit feedback, such as email or your internal ticketing system.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For tighter security, require phishing-resistant authentication when users enroll in additional authenticators. See <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/authenticators/require-phishing-resistant-authenticator.htm">Phishing-resistant authenticator enrollment</MadCap:xref>. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
