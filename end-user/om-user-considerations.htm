        <p>To check if you use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, open <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> and tap your account. If <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> has a green checkmark, your organization uses the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> sign-in method.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You must authenticate after prolonged <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> inactivity. If you haven't used <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> for more than 30 days, you are prompted to enter your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> credentials when you eventually open <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" />. This occurs because <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> relies on an internal token for authentication that expires after 30 days of inactivity. This token expiration is separate from PIN and MFA expiration occurrences.</li>
            <li>On mobile devices, some apps require you to authenticate with the app itself. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> provides one-click access to most supported apps. After signing in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, you&#160;can access the apps on your device without having to authenticate with the app itself. Many apps provide a fallback authentication method so that you can access the app by entering your app sign-in credentials.
Some apps still require you to enter your app credentials when you access them on your mobile device. If you encounter problems, contact your system administrator.
            </li>
            <li>Apps in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> open directly in the browser. If your administrator didn't enable <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Mobility Management (OMM)&#160;for your organization, apps in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> open directly in the browser when you long-press an app.</li>
            <li>On Android devices, you can't download files from an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> web browser. As a security precaution, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> doesn't support downloading files or opening attachments from an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> web browser on Android devices. This restriction minimizes malware threats. There are no restriction on opening files that don't require saving to disk.</li>
            <li>You can rate <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> on iOS devices. On iOS devices, you are prompted to rate the app in the App Store. After clicking <span class="uicontrol">Submit</span>, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Mobile" /> page opens in the App Store so that you can provide additional feedback. To dismiss this option, click <span class="uicontrol">Not now</span>.</li>
            <li>On Android 12, some features don’t work if Okta Mobile is set in restrictive mode.</li>
            <li>If you use Okta Mobile 4.21.0 on Android 11 or 12, you might not be able to access Play for Work. This message appears: “Play for Work is not available. Play for Work is still being enabled, please try again later.” To resolve this issue, set up your work profile again.</li>
