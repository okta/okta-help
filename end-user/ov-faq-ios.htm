        <h3>Can I transfer my existing <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> enrollment from one device to another?</h3>
        <p>For security reasons, you might be able to transfer <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> from one device to another only if you first remove the existing <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> enrollment tied to your original device. Then, enroll your new device in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> as described in <MadCap:xref href="ov-ios-reset-register.htm">Set up your current [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Verify%] account on a new iOS&#160;device</MadCap:xref>. If you can't access your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" />, contact your company's help desk.</p>
        <h3>I got a new device, don't have my previous one, and I don’t have additional <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> security methods set up. Can I reinstall <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> and set it up myself without contacting my IT administrator?</h3>
        <p>No. If you no longer have your previous device with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> installed on it and you aren't enrolled in an additional <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> authentication factor, you have to contact your company's help desk. </p>
        <h3>I deleted <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> from my device. Can I reinstall it and set up <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> myself without contacting my IT administrator?</h3>
        <p>If you have <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> installed on a different device, or other <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> security methods set up, such as Phone (SMS or Voice Call), Security Key or Biometric authenticator, or Google Authenticator, use one of these authenticators to sign in to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" />. Click the arrow beside your name and go to <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span>. Scroll down to Extra Verification or Security Methods. For <span class="uicontrol">Okta Verify</span>, click <span class="uicontrol">Set Up</span>. Follow the instructions to add a new <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> account on your device.

        <h3>I use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to store one-time passwords (OTP) for non-<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> services (for example, Github). Can I transfer those passwords to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> on my new device?</h3>
        <p>No. Before deleting <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> from your device or getting a new device, you must sign in to your non-<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> services to set up your new device with those codes. You will not be able to retrieve the codes after you no longer have access to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> on your original device.</p>
        <h2>Codes and Keys</h2>
        <h3>What is a QR&#160;code and why do I need to use it for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />?</h3>
        <p>A QR code is a universal barcode that can be scanned and read by your device's camera. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> uses QR&#160;codes to enroll your device with your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> account. Usually, you only do this once, but if you have to reset your account, you scan a new QR code to enroll again successfully. For how to scan the QR code, see <MadCap:xref href="ov-new-install-qr-ios.htm">Set up [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Verify%] with a QR&#160;code on your iOS&#160;device</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <p>If you can't scan the QR code, see <MadCap:xref href="ov-new-install-signin-ios.htm">Set up [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Verify%] on your iOS&#160;device by signing in to your  account</MadCap:xref> or <MadCap:xref href="ov-new-setup-no-qr-ios.htm">Set up [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Verify%] on your iOS device by using an activation link or secret key</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>What is the secret key and do I need it to sign in to my account?</h3>
        <p>When you enroll your device with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> for the first time, you have different options, depending on your company’s configuration. If you can’t set up your account with a QR code, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> generates a secret key that you can enter in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to set up your account. The secret key is not the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> 6-digit code that you enter in the sign-in window when you access your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />-protected apps. To learn more about using the secret key, see <MadCap:xref href="ov-new-setup-no-qr-ios.htm">Set up [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Verify%] on your iOS device by using an activation link or secret key</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>When I&#160;open <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />, I&#160;see a six-digit code. What is it for?&#160;</h3>
        <p>When you access apps protected by <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> generates a code that you can enter in the sign-in window to confirm your identity. You need this code only if you select the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> <span class="term">code</span> option in the authentication window. </p>

        </p>
        <p>You don’t have to use the code to sign in with Okta Verify. You can also authenticate with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> push notifications if your organization configured this option.</p>
        <p>The six-digit code is renewed every 30 seconds. After you close <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />, the code is no longer generated. </p>

        <h3>What is the blue loading bar above the code in Okta Verify?</h3>
        <p>This is not a loading bar. It’s a progress bar. The six-digit code is renewed every 30 seconds. The progress bar indicates how much time is left until a new code is generated. </p>
