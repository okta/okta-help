        <p>To restore <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> on your device, you must be able to access the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" />&#160;using a security method other than <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />,&#160;such as SMS (text), email, or Security Key or Biometric Authenticator (among others). See <MadCap:xref href="../eu-sign-in-to-apps.htm">Sign in to apps protected by [%=okta-variables.ProductName%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p> If you’re unsure whether you set up  additional security methods, enter the sign-in URL&#160;in your internet browser and enter your username and password. Based on your organization’s configuration, one of these sign-in windows might appear.</p>

        <p>Click the arrow beside the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> factor or <span class="uicontrol">Verify with something else</span> to see what other sign-in methods are available. </p>
        <p>If you don’t have any other security methods set up and can't access your company's <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" />, contact your company’s help desk. Some organizations configure user access so that you can have only one device set up with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> at a time. </p>
