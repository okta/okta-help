        <h1>Check the health of a Windows device</h1>
        <p>You can view the security health of your device to identify if it’s exposed to any security risks. </p>
        <p>Based on your organization’s configuration, several security checks are performed:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OS version: Indicates if the operating system (OS) version of your device is up to date.
</li>
            <li>Biometric verification: Indicates if biometrics (for example, Touch ID) is enabled for your device. 

</li>
            <li>Disk encryption: Indicates if the hard disk of your device is encrypted.

</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A green check mark confirms that your device meets the security rules set by your organization. A yellow exclamation mark indicates that you must change some settings to reach security compliance.</p>
        <ol>

                </li>
            <li>View the health status of each security check for your device. <ul><li>If all checks passed, your device is secure. </li><li>If you find warnings, follow the instructions to fix the issues. For example, you might have to update the Android version to include a specific security patch or to enable biometrics such face recognition or fingerprint verification for your device.<p>After you complete the remediation steps, your device meets your organization’s security rules. You can now use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> or <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to access your apps securely. </p></li></ul></li>
