        <h1>Set up Desktop Password Sync for macOS</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Desktop Password Sync" /> for macOS syncs your computer sign-in credentials with your Okta credentials.  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> is used to verify your identity to your organization and to Okta, which allows you to access restricted apps and information. After signing into your macOS device, you’re prompted to register your computer and local account by signing in with your Okta credentials using <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/sign-in-experience-may-vary.flsnp" />
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>You must have an Okta Verify account set up on your mobile device. See <MadCap:xref href="../ov-overview-andr.htm">[%=okta-feature-names.Okta Verify%] for Android</MadCap:xref> or <MadCap:xref href="../ov-overview-ios.htm">[%=okta-feature-names.Okta Verify%] for iOS</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>If your administrator requires that you use Touch ID for authentication, make sure that Touch ID is set up on your macOS device before starting the registration for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Desktop Password Sync" />.</p>
        <h2>Register your credentials</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Start your macOS computer. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter your username and password.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After successfully signing in, a system notification appears. Click <span class="uicontrol">Register</span> and follow the prompts. If you ignore or dismiss the registration request, it reappears in 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> is installed on your computer. Choose whether you want to use Touch ID as a user verification method when signing into applications. If you opt out of using Touch ID, then you don’t see prompts asking for biometrics as a verification method.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After successfully syncing your macOS local account password and your Okta password, you can sign in to your computer using your Okta password. If either password (local macOS password or Okta password) changes in the future, you may be asked to re-register your credentials to ensure your passwords remain in sync. </p>
        <h2>Sign in with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Desktop Password Sync" /></h2>
        <p>When signing in or unlocking your macOS computer, you’re prompted to sign in. Enter your Okta credentials after completing the registration flow, which sets up your Okta password to be used as your local account password.  After signing in, you have authenticated access to your local computer. Your local computer password is no longer valid or necessary. </p>
        <h2>Resync your passwords</h2>
        <p>Your org's authentication and sign-on policies may dictate that you change your password regularly. If you change your password, you must resync your local and Okta passwords.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:xref href="../manage-account-settings.htm#Reset" target="_blank">Reset your Okta password </MadCap:xref>in your apps dashboard.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Wait for the <span class="wintitle">Authentication&#160;Required</span> notification to appear, which may take up to 12 hours. Click the prompt when it appears and follow the steps to resync your password.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you want to immediately resync your password after you reset it, lock your computer screen and then unlock it with your updated password.</p>
        <p>On macOS&#160;Sonoma, you can retrigger the Authentication&#160;Required notification:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click the Apple icon in your menu bar, and then click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">System Settings</span> <span class="uicontrol">Users &amp;&#160;Groups</span></span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the information icon next to your profile picture. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Under the Platform Single Sign-on heading, click <span class="uicontrol">Authenticate</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Changing your local macOS&#160;computer password isn't recommended.&#160;Instead, change your Okta password and resync the password with your computer to use&#160;<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Desktop Password Sync" />.</p>
