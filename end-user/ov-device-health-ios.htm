        <h1>Check the health of your iOS device</h1>
        <p>You can view the security health of your device to identify if it’s exposed to any security risks. </p>
        <p>Based on your organization’s configuration, several security checks are performed:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OS version: Indicates if the operating system (OS) version of your device is up-to-date.
</li>
            <li>
Passcode is enabled: Indicates if your device is protected by a passcode. 

</li>
            <li>Disk encryption: Indicates if the hard disk of your device is encrypted.
</li>
            <li>Touch ID or Face ID: Indicates if biometric verification is enabled on your device.
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A green check mark confirms that your device meets the security rules set by your organization. A yellow exclamation mark indicates that you must change some settings to reach security compliance.</p>
        <ol>

            <li>View the health status of each security check for your device. <ul><li>If all checks passed, your device is secure. </li><li>If you find warnings, follow the instructions to fix the issues.
