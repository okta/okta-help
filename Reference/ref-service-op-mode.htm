        <h1>Okta Service Mode</h1>
        <p>Your Okta service can be in either active or read-only mode. </p>
        <p><span class="term">Active mode</span> is the normal, expected state of the Okta service. All data writes are possible and customer jobs are unaffected. </p>
        <p><span class="term">Read-only mode</span>, which is extremely rare,  indicates a reduced functionality state of the Okta service. You only experience this mode if there is a temporary issue with your org, or if there is a planned maintenance event, for which you would have advance notice.</p>
        <p> When your service is in read-only mode, you can expect the following behavior:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your Admin Console will display the following message: 
            <MadCap:dropDown><MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Screenshot</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownBody><img src="../../Resources/Images/read-only.png" style="min-width: auto;max-width: 100%;width: 924px;height: 67px;" /></MadCap:dropDownBody></MadCap:dropDown></li>
            <li>Admin actions involving data modifications (Creates, Updates and Deletes) will NOT work via the User Interface or API</li>
            <li>Jobs, both scheduled and on-demand, are suspended</li>
            <li>
                Existing end users will be able to authenticate, but will NOT get profile updates during this time,  First time sign-in for new end users will NOT work, this includes JIT provisioning flows. End-user self-service functionality beyond authentication and SSO, such as password and MFA resets, account unlock and editing settings will NOT work.
            </li>
            <li>&#160;The following areas will continue to work:<ul><li>Sign-ins, multifactor challenges/responses, SSO operations (both IdP-initiated and SP-initiated flows) </li><li>Creating OpenID Connect and API Access Management tokens (ID, access, and refresh) </li><li>API Session creation and OpenID Connect and API Access Management token flows </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
    </body>
