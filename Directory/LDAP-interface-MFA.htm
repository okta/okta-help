        <h1>Use multifactor authentication with the LDAP Interface</h1>
        <p>If your org has implemented MFA for admin users, you need to include your MFA token information and your admin password when you sign in to the LDAP&#160;Interface.</p>
        <p>To use the Verify Push factor with the LDAP Interface, users append the string <code>,push</code> to their credentials. For example, &lt;password&gt;<code>,push</code>. When using the Verify Push factor, a notification appears that users can approve or deny. The push notification is sent automatically when the user is enrolled in Verify Push and the <code>,push</code> string is not used with the credentials.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.Classic">For short message service (SMS) and voice verification, generate the token before doing the BIND. For example, after you sign in and press <span class="uicontrol">Send Code</span> and an SMS is sent to the phone. You can then do a BIND and SEARCH with that SMS in the format of <span class="term">password, text code</span>.</p>
        <p>The format for entering your password and MFA&#160;token is <cite>&lt;password,MFAtoken&gt;</cite>.</p>
        <p>For example, you enter the following for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"></MadCap:variable>: <cite>password,123456</cite>, where password is your admin user password, and 123456 is the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"></MadCap:variable> passcode.</p>
