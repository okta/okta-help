      <h1>Add or remove custom LDAP attributes</h1>
      <p>For Universal Directory, LDAP is just another application. That is, LDAP has its own unique App User Profile within <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>. You can view user profiles for directories in the Profile Editor.</p>
      <p>The Profile Editor gives admins complete control over the LDAP app profile for a user. Admins can add and remove attributes from the profile, customize attribute mappings, and perform data transformations within the inbound or outbound flows. </p>
      <p>You can only add attributes to the LDAP profile if they're already in the LDAP directory, so <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> first does a schema discovery step to populate the attribute picker. For <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> to discover the attribute, it must be added to an object within the User object hierarchy. For the attribute to be discovered during this process, it must be added to either the user object, a parent object, or an auxiliary object.</p>
      <p>Executing schema discovery takes a few seconds. When it's finished, you're provided with a list of the attributes that <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> is permitted to discover in LDAP. </p>

         MadCap:conditions="Primary.review-only">Back-linked attributes, such as memberOf are computed attributes and aren't  stored in your Active Directory database. As a result, changes to the user object aren't visible to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> and  an import operation isn't performed when  changes occur. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> recommends that you avoid the use of computed attributes as mapped attributes. This is especially true if you require changes in downstream systems as a result of attribute changes. The use of computed attributes as mapped attributes may lead to inconsistent data between your on-premises Active Directory instance and Universal Directory.
