        <h1>Get started with Active Directory integration</h1>
        <p>Start here if you're new to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Active Directory integrations, you want to review integration prerequisites and known issues, you want help planning your integration, or you want to quickly locate support information.</p>
        <p>If you're reviewing this information, it's likely that your enterprise uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as the authoritative user directory that governs access to email, file sharing, and other business applications. In all likelihood, you're also using Software as a Service (SaaS) applications that aren't integrated with AD and finding it increasingly difficult managing all of your user accounts. Managing multiple separate user directories is not only inefficient, it also exposes your enterprise to increased security risk. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Active Directory integration helps your enterprise seamlessly integrate your SaaS applications and your AD instance with <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. </p>
