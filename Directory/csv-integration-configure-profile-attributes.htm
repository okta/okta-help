      <h1>Configure the CSV directory integration profile attributes</h1>
      <ol>
         <li>
                In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard"/>, go to <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Directory</span>
               <span class="uicontrol">Profile Editor</span>
            </span>.</li>
         <li>Find your CSV application and select <span class="uicontrol">Mappings</span>.</li>
         <li>Map the CSV application's user profile attributes to user attributes in the Okta user profile. For an import to be successful, the following fields are mandatory. These default properties are created during app activation or reactivation if they don't exist.<ul>
               <li>login</li>
               <li>firstName</li>
               <li>lastName</li>
               <li>email</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also use the following default mappings by entering them as your headers within the CSV file (CSV app user =&gt; Okta user). These attribute headers are case-sensitive.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <span class="varname">userName</span> =&gt; login</li>
               <li>
                  <span class="varname">firstName</span> =&gt; firstName</li>
               <li>
                  <span class="varname">lastName</span> =&gt; lastName</li>
               <li>
                  <span class="varname">email</span> =&gt; email</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As an admin, you can update the attributes you want to map by using the Okta Expression Language.  </p>
         </li>
         <li>Optional. Use the profile editor to map alternative attributes from your CSV file instead of using the Okta default attributes, or you can import other fields as custom attributes. In either case, complete these steps:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
               <li>Find your CSV application in the<span class="uicontrol"> Profile Editor</span> page and select <span class="uicontrol">Profile</span>.</li>
               <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Add Attribute</span>, add the new attribute, and save.</li>
               <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Map Attributes</span>, and map the new attribute, which will replace the Okta default.</li>
               <li>You can delete the Okta default attribute.</li>
               <li>Save your changes.<p>The new attribute appears under <span class="menucascade">
                        <span class="uicontrol">Filters</span>
                        <span class="uicontrol">Custom</span>
                     </span>.</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>Okta queries the name that you specify when determining which headers in the CSV file correspond to the attribute.
               <li>Okta only supports non-array attributes (that is, string, boolean, integer, number).</li>
               <li>Mapping a unique identifier from the CSV file isn't required. If you would prefer that the unique identifier be populated on the user profile, access the mappings and configure it there.</li>
               <li>If there are other attributes you want to import from the CSV file, they must be added to your schema. If your CSV file has attributes or headers that aren't configured within your user profile, Okta ignores them and their associated values for each user.</li>
               <li>If a CSV column isn't included as an attribute in a CSV user profile, the data from that column is ignored. For example, if you've configured <span class="uicontrol">userName</span>, <span class="uicontrol">firstName</span>, <span class="uicontrol">lastName</span>, <span class="uicontrol">email</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">employeeId</span> within the profile editor, but your CSV includes an additional attribute with the <span class="uicontrol">Address</span> header, Okta won't import <span class="uicontrol">Address</span> or any values populated for a user with an address.</li>
               <li>Plain text password migration isn't supported.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ol>
