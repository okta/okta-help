        <h1>Integration with existing Active Directory forests and domains</h1>
        <p>When planning your Active Directory (AD) integration, review your existing AD implementation and answer these questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many domains do you have?</li>
            <li>What kind of trusts are in place?</li>
            <li>What forests do you have?</li>
            <p>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> supports communication across domains, but not across forests.</p>
            <p>An <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> must be installed in each forest and each domain in a forest where there are users you intend to import into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. While is it possible  to register multiple domains to a single agent, all domains are affected if the agent becomes unavailable.</p>
            <p>It isn't a requirement to install an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> in a resource forest because there are typically no users in the forest, just network resources.</p>
            <li>Which organizational units (OUs) do you plan to import into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />?</li>
            <li>Are there users or resources in those OUs that you don't need to import into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Installing the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> requires the use of an AD service account. It's important that the service account has permissions in all domains in that forest to read and access users in all domains to which the agent connects. For details about the service accounts that are required to install the agent, refer to <MadCap:xref href="ad-agent-prerequisites.htm">Active Directory integration prerequisites</MadCap:xref>. </p>
