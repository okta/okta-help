        <h1>Learn about the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.IWA&#160;Web agent" /></h1>
        <p>The	<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> IWA Web agent is a lightweight Internet Information Services (IIS) web agent that enables Desktop Single Sign-on (DSSO) on the&#160;<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> service.&#160;DSSO allows users to be automatically authenticated by <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> and any apps accessed through <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable>, whenever they sign into your Windows network. The <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> IWA Web agent uses Microsoft's IWA and ASP.NET to authenticate users from specified gateway IPs.&#160;</p>

        <p>When you have only one forest it doesn't matter to which IWA agent requests are routed. When you have multiple forests, you need to start taking network configuration into consideration. You need to ensure that user A on machine A only redirects to IWA agents that are in forest A, and user B on machine B only redirects to agents that are in forest B. The suggested way of doing that is redirecting the traffic from <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to a global redirect URL, and then setting up your on-prem DNS&#160;to do the correct routing for that endpoint. You may also need to set up on-prem load balancing and the ability to detect which agents are online and offline into your load balancer.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> strongly recommends that you transition to using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with the on-premises agent. This is not only an important security provision, but it is also a hard requirement for application  authentication (in particular, Windows 10 Universal Applications such as OneNote, Mail).</p>

        <p>When re-enabling  IWA DSSO, Identity Provider (IDP) routing rules must be manually reactivated.</p>
