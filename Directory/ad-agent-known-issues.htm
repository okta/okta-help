        <h1>Active Directory integration known issues</h1>
        <p>The following are the known issues with Active Directory (AD) integrations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If you're using a custom URL:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">Agents</span>: Use the actual domain (<span class="url">example.okta.com</span>) and not the custom domain (<span class="url">example.customname.com</span>). </li>
                    <li MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.Classic"><span class="uicontrol">IWA SSO</span>: Modify the <span class="filepath">web.config</span> file to include the custom url. <br /><span class="codeblock">&lt;oktaSSOConfigGroup&gt;<br />&lt;oktaSSOConfig orgOktaAuthenticationURL="https://example.customname.com/login/sso_iwa_auth"<br />orgBackupOktaAuthenticationURL="https://example.customname.com/login/default"<br />oktaSSOWebAppVersion="1.11.5.0"&gt;</span><br /></li>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">Agentless DSSO</span>: Make sure that all  sign-in flows and browser bookmarks use the correct URL.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>When you add a new attribute to an AD domain, restart every <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> connected to the domain. If an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> isn't restarted, an Active Directory restriction  causes the AD agents to base-64 encode the new attribute's values.</li>
            <li>When renaming an AD&#160;domain, uninstall the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> before you start the renaming process. When you complete the renaming process, reinstall the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> with the new domain name. A renamed domain appears as a new AD app instance in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</li>
            <li>
                Sometimes, group membership information for AD-sourced users that is imported into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> during Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning isn't removed by full or incremental imports. Subsequent JIT or profile updates are required to update group membership information.
</li>
            <li>When the provisioning settings indicate <span class="uicontrol">Do nothing</span> when users are deactivated, users remain active in Okta. When a single source provides user profile attributes, deactivated users are disconnected from the source and Okta becomes the source for user profile attributes. </li>
            <li>
                <p>When there's a large number of JIT-enabled directory integrations, JIT performance can degrade and cause the JIT request to fail with a timeout while searching for a user in all these directories.</p>
                <p>There are several factors that can contribute to JIT's performance degradation such as the performance of the on-prem agents and on-prem directory servers and the Okta service. If you experience any persistent issues, visit the <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/?language=en_US" target="_blank">Okta Help Center</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
                In Okta Active Directory agent version 3.6.0 and later, the proxy password is encrypted and can only be read by the service account. If you specify a proxy username, you need to reenter the proxy password when using the Okta AD Agent Manager to register domains and similar tasks.
</li>
            <li>When <span class="uicontrol">Deactivate Users</span> is disabled on the <span class="uicontrol">Provisioning</span> tab, users that are deactivated from AD and reactivated in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> through JIT provisioning don’t have Distribution Groups assigned to them. To resolve this, deactivate the user from AD and perform a full import.</li>
        </ul>
