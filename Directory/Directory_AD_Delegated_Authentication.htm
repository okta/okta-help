        <h1>About delegated authentication with Active Directory</h1>
        <p>When <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> is integrated with an Active Directory (AD)&#160;instance,  delegated authentication is enabled by default.  With delegated authentication, this is what happens when users sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users enter their username and password in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> sign-in page. </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.Classic">The sign-in page is protected with a security image to prevent phishing.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.OIE">Users are prompted to enter their secondary email upon first sign-in. <div class="noteOkta" MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.OIE"><p class="noteContent">Secondary email is important for password recovery, especially when the Okta password  and the primary email password is the same, which is common for AD users.</p></div></li>
            <li>Multifactor authentication (an extra security question or smart phone soft token) may also be enabled.</li>
            <li>The username and password are transmitted over the SSL connection implemented during setup to an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent" /> running behind a firewall.</li>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" />  passes the user credentials to the AD domain controller for authentication.</li>
            <li>The AD domain controller validates the username and password and uses the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent short" /> to return a yes or no response to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</li>
            <li>A yes response  confirms the user's identity and they are authenticated and sent to their <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> homepage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Delegated authentication maintains persistence for your directory authenticated (DelAuth) sessions and AD is maintained as the immediate and ultimate source for credential validation. As AD is responsible for authenticating users, changes to a user’s status (such as password changes or deactivations) are  immediately pushed to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>To retain delegated authentication functionality, the <span class="uicontrol">Access this computer from the network</span> security policy setting must be assigned to domain users on the AD server where the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AD agent" /> is installed.</p>
