        <h1>LDAP integration known issues</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Oracle Internet Directory</span>:  Oracle Internet Directory (OID) 11.1.1.7.0 has been tested and is supported with the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.LDAP agent short" /> v5.04.01 and later. When <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> searches an LDAP Directory, it uses a paged search control to optimize how results are returned to the agent. Due to an OID pagination issue (Oracle bug 25287786), <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.LDAP agent short" /> can't query for more objects than the default LDAP page size. While resolution from Oracle is pending, customers should evaluate the configuration of the <span class="term">orclsizelimit</span> attribute within their directory to balance scalability, performance, and interoperability. Further details are available within the Oracle Internet Directory Administrator's Guide. </li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Incremental Import</span>:  Each user, group, organizational unit (OU), or container entry in the LDAP server must have an accurate <span class="code">modifyTimestamp</span> value for incremental import to work. If this isn't possible, don't use incremental import. </li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">LDAP proxy server</span>: Connecting the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.LDAP agent" /> to an LDAP server through an LDAP proxy server with its own schema may cause issues with importing user data. These occur when the schemas of the LDAP Proxy Server and LDAP server are different. To avoid data importation issues, make sure that the LDAP proxy server and LDAP server schemas are identical. Alternatively, you should make sure that schema discovery requests sent to the LDAP server are transparent. </li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</span>: The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.LDAP agent short" /> isn't supported on the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Self service account unlock</span>: Users can't unlock LDAP sourced accounts that have been locked. Only an admin can unlock them.</li>
            <li>Large numbers of JIT-enabled directory integrations can degrade JIT performance. This can cause JIT requests to fail with timeouts when searching for users in multiple directories. Several factors can contribute to JIT's performance degradation such as the performance of the on-premises agents and on-premises directory servers and the Okta service.

            <li><span class="uicontrol">Active Directory LDS</span>: Updating a user’s <span class="userinput">givenName</span> or <span class="userinput">SN</span> causes an error if the directory is configured to use CN as part of the DN. The following error is logged on the LDAP Agent: <span class="msgblock">Error during ModifyRequest. ResultCode=67 (not allowed on RDN) exception=com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPException: 000020B1: UpdErr: DSID-030F113B, problem 6004 (CANT_ON_RDN), data 0</span>.</li>
