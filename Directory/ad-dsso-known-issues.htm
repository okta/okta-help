        <h1>Active Directory Desktop Single Sign-on known issues</h1>
        <p>These are the known issues when implementing a new Desktop Single Sign-on (DSSO) configuration or migrating an existing DSSO&#160;configuration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agentless DSSO does not work if a single user has memberships to more than 600 security groups or if the Kerberos token is too large for Okta to currently consume. If a user with a large Kerberos packet implements or migrates Agentless DSSO, a 400 response appears and they are redirected to the regular sign-in page.
</li>
            <li>Windows functional level 2008 or below uses a less secure encryption RC4. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> recommends upgrading to Windows functional level 2008 or above to make sure you are using the most secure encryption algorithm.</li>
            <li>When Agentless DSSO is re-enabled, Identity Provider (IDP) routing rules must be manually reactivated.</li>
            <li>Agentless DSSO does not work when delegated authentication is disabled and <span class="uicontrol">Don't create Okta password</span> is selected. To learn more about delegated authentication, see <a href="../Security/Security_Authentication.htm">Delegated authentication</a>.</li>
            <li>The default sign-in page used for automatic DSSO&#160;failover does not support HTML customization.</li>
            <li>An infinite redirection loop can occur when the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Provider full name" /> (IdP) customer error page and the org URL are the same.</li>
            <li>
                When the service account user name and the Active Directory user account name don’t match, Agentless DSSO can fail. When this happens, you are returned to the default sign-in page and a GSS_ERR error appears in the Syslog. The service account user name and the Active Directory user account are case sensitive and must match.
            </li>
            <li>
                RC4_HMAC_MD5 encryption is not supported with  ADSSO and Office 365 Silent Activation. When using ADSSO or Office 365 Silent Activation, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> recommends using AES 128-bit (AES-128) or AES 256-bit (AES-256) encryption.
If the KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOTSUPP error appears in the Windows Event Viewer when you implement AES encryption, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/unsupported-etype-error-accessing-trusted-domain">Kerberos Unsupported etype error</a>.</li>
            <li>
                Microsoft Edge (Legacy) is not supported. New Chromium-based Edge is supported.
            </li>
            <li>
                Microsoft Teams versions 4.0.8.0 and later are supported.
            </li>
        </ul>
