      <h1>CSV directory integration prerequisites</h1>
      <p>The following are the prerequisites for CSV directory integrations:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Provisioning Agent"/> is lightweight and runs on either Linux (CentOS or RHEL) or Microsoft Windows Server (x86/x64), and sits behind a firewall. To find the download link, sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>, select <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span>
               <span class="uicontrol">Downloads</span>
            </span>, and navigate to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Provisioning Agent"/> section. </li>
         <li>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Provisioning Agent"/> version must be 1.03.00 or higher. If you previously installed an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Provisioning Agent"/>, it will not function for this feature. See  <MadCap:xref href="../Provisioning/opp/OPP-install-agent.htm">Install the [%=okta-feature-names.Okta Provisioning Agent%]</MadCap:xref>.</li>
         <li>Your CSV file must have a <strong style="font-weight: normal;">.csv</strong> extension and must be saved to an on-premises file folder.</li>
         <li>Your CSV file must be in UTF-8 format. When the CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) option is selected in some versions of Microsoft Excel, the UTF-8 character encoding is not recognized and imports can fail.</li>
         <li>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Provisioning Agent"/> must have read permissions for the CSV file.</li>
         <li>All active users must be present for every CSV import. Your CSV file is a representation of all active users from your source system. All active users must be present in every CSV import or the user is considered inactive. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> uses the Unique Identifier that you designated as the primary identifier for each user. The import behaves as follows: <ul>
               <li>If a user is missing during the latest import, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> assumes the user is no longer active and deactivates the user in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>.</li>
               <li>If a new user appears who did not exist in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> during a previous import as denoted by their unique identifier, then <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> creates the user.</li>
               <li>If a user is present in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> and was present in the latest import, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> treats the current data in the CSV file as the source of truth, and executes any updates to that user’s attributes.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>All required attributes must be present for every CSV import. The unique identifier and all attributes marked as <span class="uicontrol">Attribute Required</span> in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> Profile Editor must be present in the CSV file. If any of the required attributes is missing for a user, the following results:<ul>
               <li>For an existing user, the user is deactivated from <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>
               </li>
               <li>For a new user, the import fails</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>All attributes and headers must be formatted properly<ul>
               <li>Required attribute headers are case-sensitive.</li>
               <li>Use only variable names, not display names as CSV headers. </li>
               <li>Do not use empty spaces surrounding the headers within the CSV—they are not ignored.</li>
               <li>The Profile Editor ignores any column within the CSV with a header attribute not previously configured.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Optional attributes must be present to be updated. If an attribute is optional, and there is no header in the CSV file for the optional attribute, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> does not update that attribute, but it updates all other attributes.</li>
      </ul>
