        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/ea-banner.flsnp" />
        <p>You can specify the app to which end users are redirected when they visit your org directly and Okta doesn't know which app they are trying to access. (Authentication flows initiated by applications are unaffected; authenticated users in that case are still redirected to the initiating app, not the custom redirect URL that you configure in this procedure.)</p>
        <p>Additionally, you can use this setting to manage where to redirect users following password and MFA resets, user recovery, and other recovery flows. In this way, this feature lets you hide the Okta Dashboard from your end users by sending them instead to a different default application or domain that you specify.</p>
        <p>This feature also overrides any default redirect URL that may be configured.</p>
        <p>To configure this redirect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Admin Console, go to <span class="uicontrol">Customizations</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="uicontrol">Other</span>.</li>
            <li>Scroll to <span class="uicontrol">Default App for Sign-In Widget</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Send to Custom URL</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To return to the Okta Dashboard, navigate to <span class="filepath">&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/login/default</span>.</p>
