        <p>On the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" />, your end users can view app settings and details for apps that have been added to their dashboard. If an app as been added by an admin, there are multiple configuration options available that allow for end users to securely access sensitive information from within their app settings. Alternatively, admins can choose to limit an end user's access to sensitive information for an app.</p>
        <p>Configuration options vary depending on the type of app that is added to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" />:&#160;</p>
