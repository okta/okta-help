        <h2>What's staying</h2>
        <p>The dashboard doesn't affect the user interface or the settings for the following functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sign-in page customization. For example, sign-in flows, reset password flows, self-service unlock flows</li>
            <li>
                <p>Translation for  26 supported languages</p>
            </li>
            <li>User Settings page</li>
            <li>Loading pages</li>
            <li>User onboarding flow</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Some functions are unsupported in the new experience. If you require one of these features for your org, contact <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Support" /> for assistance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Secure my Mac</span> flows from the Dashboard</p>
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If an org enables the Device Trust feature, apps that can't be accessed from an untrusted device appear with a gray color and a locked icon. In the new <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" />, these apps don't display a locked icon but are inaccessible to users when accessed from an untrusted device.</p>
