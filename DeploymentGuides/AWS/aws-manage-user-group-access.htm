        <h1><a name="Managing"></a>About  AWS user and group access management</h1>
        <p>Connecting <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances using groups is supported primarily in an external directory. Administrators work with two logical sets of  external directory groups: AWS role-specific groups and management groups.</p>
        <h2>AWS role-specific groups</h2>
        <p>A group must exist  within an external directory for each specific account and role combination for which you want to provide access. Think of these groups as <i>AWS role-specific groups</i>. </p>
        <p>A user who is a member of a role-specific group is granted a single-entitlement access to one specific role in one specific AWS account.  A role-specific group can be created by a script, exported as a list from AWS, or created manually.</p>
        <h2>Management groups</h2>
        <p>It's not efficient to manage user access by assigning each user to specific AWS role groups. Instead, create a number of groups—management groups, for all distinct user sets in your organization that require different sets of AWS entitlements.</p>
        <p>These groups may already exist in your external directory hierarchy in the form of different department-specific groups, but you can also create them solely for AWS.</p>
        <p>The management groups are the administration layer where you assign users (as groupMembers) and map these users to specific entitlements through AWS role groups (as Members Of).</p>
        <p>Once you create the management groups in an external directory, use these groups to perform all administrative tasks including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding and removing users</li>
            <li>Granting access to AWS accounts and roles</li>
            <li>Updating specific entitlements by adding or removing AWS Role Groups in the Member Of group property</li>
        </ul>
