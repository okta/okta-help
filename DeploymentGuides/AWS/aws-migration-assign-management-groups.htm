        <h1>AWS migration - assign all AWS management groups to the AWS app in Okta</h1>
        <p>Lastly, now that the AWS app has been properly configured to map AWS role groups to entitlements, assign all of your AWS Management Groups to the application in Okta. This will automatically assign all of the appropriate users to the AWS app, and the instructions you completed in the step above will ensure that they only see the appropriate entitlements they should have access to.</p>
        <p>Setup is now complete! Verify that users can access the AWS app from their Okta end-user dashboard and sign-on is seamless. You can now disable the previous AWS app to avoid any conflicts.</p>
