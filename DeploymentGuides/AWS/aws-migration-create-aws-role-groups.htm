        <h1>AWS migration - create AWS&#160;role groups </h1>
        <p>Once all AWS accounts have been configured for SAML, groups must be created for each AWS role in each account that you want users to have access to. This can be accomplished in a few different ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Option 1: Script between AWS and AD/LDAP connected to Okta that creates AD groups for each role in each account<p>This offers the greatest possibility of automation but requires coordination between your AWS management teams and AD / LDAP management teams for the script to be configured. In the future, Okta hopes to provide sample scripts to help simplify the setup, but these are currently not available</p></li>
            <li>Option 2: CSV Export from AWS<p>If a scripting approach between AWS and AD/LDAP is not possible, a lighter weight approach may be to simply export a list of role names for each of your AWS accounts in a CSV that you can later import to Okta</p></li>
            <li>Option 3: Manual Creation<p>You can also create AWS Role Groups in Okta manually. This model is the simplest, however, it will require upkeep as well as ample setup time to create groups in Okta for each of the roles in each of your accounts.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regardless of how you choose to create these AWS Role Specific Groups in your directory, we recommend the following format for the group names:</p>
        <p>aws#[account alias]#[role name]#[account #]</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>aws#northamerica-production#Tier1_Support#828416469395</p>
        <p>If you prefer to use your own group syntax, make sure to include account alias, role name, and account # with recognizable delimiters in between each. This will also require you to be able to create a custom regex expression in later steps and therefore should only be done if you are comfortable with these advanced topics.</p>
