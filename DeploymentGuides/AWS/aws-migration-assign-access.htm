        <h1>AWS migration - assign access for users and groups in Okta</h1>
        <p>Use the following procedures in Okta to assign access to your users and groups. Okta users who belong to groups that you assign here are synchronized automatically to AWS SSO. To minimize administrative overhead in both Okta and AWS SSO, we recommend that you assign and push groups instead of individual users.

</p>
        <p>After you complete this step and the first synchronization with SCIM is completed, the users and groups that you have assigned appear in AWS SSO. Those users are able to access the AWS SSO user portal using their Okta credentials.</p>
        <p>To assign access for users in Okta</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the AWS Single Sign-On app page, select the Assignments tab.</li>
            <li>In the Assignments page, choose Assign, and then choose Assign to People.</li>
            <li>Select the Okta user or users whom you want to assign access to the AWS Single Sign-On app. Choose Assign, choose Save and Go Back, and then choose Done. This starts the process of provisioning the user or users into AWS SSO.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To assign access for groups in Okta</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the AWS Single Sign-On app page, choose the Assignments tab.</li>
            <li>In the Assignments page, choose Assign, and then choose Assign to Groups.</li>
            <li>Select the Okta group or groups that you want to assign access to the AWS Single Sign-On app. Choose Assign, choose Save and Go Back, and then choose Done. This starts the process of provisioning the users in the group into AWS SSO.</li>
            <li>Choose the Push Groups tab, choose the Okta group or groups that you selected in the previous step. Then choose Save. The group status changes to Active after the group and its members have successfully been pushed to AWS SSO.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To assign access for groups in Okta</p>
        <p>To grant your Okta users access to AWS accounts and cloud applications, complete the following applicable procedures from the AWS SSO console:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To grant access to AWS accounts, see Assign User Access.</li>
            <li>To grant access to cloud applications, see Assign User Access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can now disable the previous AWS app to avoid any conflicts.</p>
