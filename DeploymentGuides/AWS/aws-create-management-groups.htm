        <h1><a name="Step4"></a>Create management groups to map users to AWS accounts and roles</h1>
        <p>You need to create another set of external-directory groups to establish a link between sets of users and the specific AWS accounts and roles that they want to access. Management groups are the primary method for managing user access to AWS entitlements.</p>
        <p>If you're using <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> groups, you don't need to complete this procedure. See <MadCap:xref href="aws-enable-role-based.htm">Enable group-based role mapping in [%=okta-variables.ProductName%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If you do not have existing groups  to manage AWS user entitlements, complete these tasks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Create an organizational unit (OU) in your directory for AWS management groups. It does not matter where these groups are located  in the directory.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Create groups for each user population that requires a different set of AWS roles and accounts. Give meaningful names to the groups. For example: <i>Tier 1 AWS Support</i>, <i>Database Admins</i>, <i>AWS Super Admins</i></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Assign each management group to the AWS role group or groups that it needs to access. This establishes a link between the management groups and the entitlements in all AWS accounts to which group users need to access.</p>
            </li>
            <li>For each management group, on the <span class="uicontrol">Members Of</span> tab of the <span class="wintitle">DevOps Sys Admins Properties</span> dialog box add, remove, modify, or audit AWS entitlements.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="uicontrol">Members</span> tab of the <span class="wintitle">DevOps Sys Admins Properties</span> dialog box, assign individual users to the management groups to make them members of the  AWS role group.</li>
        </ol>
