        <h1>AWS&#160;migration options</h1>
        <p>Okta’s integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) has evolved over the years. With the addition of AWS’s own SSO and SCIM integration, we want to give you options to improve your existing integration setup.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have a single AWS instance configured to connect roles to Okta users via the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) API. We encourage you to either:<ul><li>Consider using AWS’s new SSO and SCIM integration: AWS has built their own OIN app that handles SSO and SCIM provisioning. If you have made the transition to AWS organizations or would like to, this is a great opportunity to use AWS’s new integration.</li><li>Update your AWS policy to be more restrictive.</li></ul></li>
            <li>If you have multiple AWS instances configured to connect roles to Okta users via the IAM API, this approach is no longer supported by Okta. We encourage you to either:<ul><li>Consider using AWS’s new SSO and SCIM integration: AWS has built their own OIN app that handles SSO and SCIM provisioning. If you have made the transition to AWS organizations or would like to, this is a great opportunity to use AWS’s new integration.</li><li>Migrate to using user groups to manage multiple AWS instances: We provide full instructions on how to migrate from using the API to using user groups.</li><li>Update your AWS policy: The best approach is to migrate to the new AWS’s new integration or to user groups, but we understand this can be difficult and complex with multiple app instances so we offer an option to adjust your AWS policy to be more restrictive.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
