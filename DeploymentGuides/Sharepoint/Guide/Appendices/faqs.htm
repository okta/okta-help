        <h4>When conﬁguring SP2013 or SP2016 web applications to use OKTA auth, do I have to run a script to convert the user accounts in SP to OKTA formatted claims?</h4>
        <p>Yes, that is required if you want to keep the same permissions previously assigned to Windows accounts. We do not provide such a script, mainly because the structure of the Okta ID claim may not easily be inferred from the structure of the NTLM ID claim.</p>
        <h4>Does OKTA support SharePoint 2010?</h4>
        <p>No. Okta supports SharePoint 2013, 2016, and 2019.</p>
        <h4>When browsing to an NTLM AND OKTA enabled SharePoint web application, will users be presented with an authentication prompt to choose which authentication to use?</h4>
        <p>By default, yes.</p>
