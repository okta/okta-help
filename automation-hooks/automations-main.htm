        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">FF AUTOMATIONS; EA 2019.02.0 Production 2019.11.0</p>
        <p>Okta automations enable you to  prepare and respond to situations that occur during the lifecycle of  end users who are assigned to an Okta group. </p>
        <h2><a name="Oktaautomationactive"></a>Okta Automations for active users</h2>
        <p>Okta automations looks for active users who have not logged into Okta for a set number of days. For automations, an active user refers to a user with an active Okta account. Accounts become active when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Admins add a user (Add Person) in the <span class="wintitle">Manage users</span> page and you set the user password without requiring email verification.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An end user self-registers into your custom app or the <span class="wintitle">Okta Homepage</span> and email verification is not required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Admins explicitly activate user accounts.</p>
            </li>
            <div class="noteOkta" MadCap:conditions="Primary.review-only">
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/assets/Icons/Notes/Help.png" class="noteImgFloat" title="Note" alt="Note" />
                <p>&#160;Admins must manually activate the user account. The user is in an active state, but  has not completed the activation process.</p>
            </div>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Oktaautomationinactive"></a>Okta Automations for inactive users</h2>
        <p>Users are considered inactive  and if no activity is detected on an active account for a defined number of days. For example, if a user is inactive for a defined number of days and is on the verge of being locked out, an automation can send an alert to the inactive user in advance.</p>
        <h2>Automations setup</h2>
        <p>Set up an automation by defining conditions and actions.</p>
        <h3>Conditions</h3>
        <p>Conditions are the criteria that triggers Okta to perform actions upon a group of end users. For each automation, you can choose one condition to apply to one or more groups.</p>
        <p>Conditions can be scheduled to run once or to recur daily and can be applied to one or more groups. Conditions are mandatory for automations on recurring schedules, and optional for automations scheduled to run once.</p>
        <p>The following conditions are  available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User inactivity in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable></li>
            <li>User password expiration in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <p>Actions represent the steps that you want Okta to perform when the scheduled conditions are true. Automations scheduled to run once, require that the user is active.</p>
        <ul>
            <p>The following actions are  available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Send email to the user </li>
                <li>Change user lifecycle state in Okta </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
