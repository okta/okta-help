        <h1>Import apps from Okta Workforce</h1>
        <p>If you use Okta at work, you probably have some personal apps on your Okta dashboard. Moving those apps to Okta Personal separates them from your work apps and maintains your access if you change jobs.</p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>Moving apps is a two-step process. First, you need to link your Okta Workforce and Okta Personal accounts. Linking your Okta accounts lets you see the apps on your work dashboard that are registered with a personal email address. Apps that are registered with a work domain aren't eligible to move.</p>
        <p>Then, select the apps that you want to move. Remember that app import is a one-way process. After the import, you can't restore your personal apps back to your Okta Workforce account.</p>
        <h2>Complete the process</h2>
