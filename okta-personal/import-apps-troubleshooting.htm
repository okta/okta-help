        <h1>Troubleshoot app imports</h1>
        <p>If you have trouble moving apps from your workforce account, check the following issues.</p>
        <h2>I don't see any of these options on my phone.</h2>
        <p>You can't import apps on a mobile device. This feature is for desktop browsers only.</p>
        <h2>I don't see the plugin icon in my desktop browser taskbar.</h2>
        <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Manage Extensions</span>. Toggle the Okta Browser Plugin  switch to enable it.</p>
        <h2>The Import apps option isn't in my menu.</h2>
        <p>Verify that your Okta Workforce account appears in the browser plugin and that you signed in to it with your workforce credentials. See <MadCap:xref href="link-your-accounts.htm">Link your accounts</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>I&#160;selected Import apps but I&#160;don't see any apps.</h2>
        <p>Verify that you have personal apps on your work dashboard. Apps that use a work domain aren't eligible to move. </p>
        <p> If you  have eligible apps but they don't appear on your <span class="wintitle">Import apps</span> page, be sure that your org allows moving personal apps.</p>
        <h2>Some of the apps I&#160;imported didn't move.</h2>
        <p>Check the number of apps that you tried to move. You can't move more than 100 apps from your Okta Workforce account. </p>
