        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>A project in  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> is an authorization <span class="disableGlossary">scope</span>, similar to a <span class="disableGlossary">domain</span> in <span class="disableGlossary">Active Directory</span>, or a realm in <span class="disableGlossary">Kerberos</span>.</p>
        <p>A project associates a collection of resources with a set of configurations, including Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and access policies.</p>
        <p>Projects are used to manage access to Windows servers, Linux servers, or web applications. You can think of a project as a programmable Certificate Authority for <span class="disableGlossary">client</span> certificates, including OpenSSH CA certificates and X.509 certificates, as well as signed objects such as JWTs.</p>
        <p>No matter what you choose to secure with  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" />, you'll need to create at least one project. </p>
