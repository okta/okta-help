        <h1>Server Enrollment</h1>
        <p>To allow access to a server, teams must install the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> <span class="disableGlossary">server agent</span>, and  enroll the server agent into a specific project. If a team uses the default configuration, the <span class="disableGlossary"><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> server agent</span> manages user accounts and groups on the server and allows users to open SSH or RDP connections through the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> client.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Enrolling an existing server in a new project may cause users or groups added by original project to become inaccessible using <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" />. These accounts and groups aren't removed from the server but become orphaned and unmanaged.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Enrollment methods</h2>
        <p>Teams can enroll servers using the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatic enrollment: This method requires teams to configure a project to gather discover and enroll servers using metadata gathered from a cloud service provider. Automatic enrollment is enabled by default. See <MadCap:xref href="../cloud-deployment.htm">Cloud servers</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Token enrollment: This method requires teams to generate a token and add it to a token file stored on the server. Automatic enrollment takes precedence over enrollment tokens. To permit&#160;token enrollment, teams may need to set the <span class="uicontrol">AutoEnroll: false</span> option in the server agent configuration file. See <MadCap:xref href="../server-enroll-token.htm">Create a server enrollment token</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
