      <h1>Configure group sync</h1>
      <p>After configuring SCIM for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT"/>, you'll want to sync your groups from <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT"/> to provision roles and membership.</p>
      <p>To configure group sync:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>Create some users and groups in Okta and assign the groups to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT"/> application. See <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/Content/Topics/Provisioning/lcm/lcm-assign-app-groups.htm"
                  target="_blank">Assign an app integration to a group</a>.</p>
            <p>Note: Any users and groups that were created in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT"/> before configuring SCIM must be removed and then re-added in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> for them be managed automatically.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> admin dashboard, open the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> Advanced Server Access application and click the <span class="uicontrol">Push Groups</span> tab. From this tab, you can configure any <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> group to be automatically synced with the downstream Advanced Server Access application. </p>
         </li>
         <li>Click <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Push Groups</span>
               <span class="uicontrol">Find groups by name</span>
            </span>. </li>
         <li>Enter the name of a group to push from <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT"/>. Click the group when it appears in the search results to add it to the list of groups to push. If <span class="uicontrol">Push group membership immediately</span> is selected, the group will be immediately pushed to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT"/> after saving these changes. </li>
         <li>Repeat the previous step for each additional group that you want to sync to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT"/>.</li>
         <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span> to finish adding groups to the list. </li>
         <li>To activate group push for a group whose membership was not immediately pushed, click <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Inactive</span>
               <span class="uicontrol">Activate group push</span>
            </span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>After group push is activated for a group, the sync takes place immediately and the group's <span class="uicontrol">Push Status</span> entry changes to <span class="uicontrol">Active</span> after the push is complete.</p>
