        <h1>Attribute conflicts</h1>
        <p>If you specify custom attributes for users or <span class="disableGlossary">groups</span>, duplicate attribute values can cause conflicts that can't be automatically resolved safely. For example, suppose there are two users on a project, AliceA and AliceB, that have the same team-level Unix username "alice". These users can't be synchronized to any project servers, because there can only be one instance of a username on a server. In such cases, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> can't determine which user should be synced unambiguously.</p>
        <p>If a conflict can be resolved by preferring one user or group's project-level attribute over another's team-level attribute, then <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> syncs the user or group with the preferred project-level attribute. Since the project-level setting is more specific, it is preferred over the team-level setting.</p>
        <p>While two or more project-level attributes with the same value are not allowed, duplicate team attributes are permitted as they don't cause a conflict until the users or <span class="disableGlossary">groups</span> with the duplicate value are assigned to the same project.</p>
        <p>To resolve a conflict in a project, edit the user or group attributes so that there are no duplicate attribute values.</p>
        <h2>View attribute conflicts</h2>
        <p>To view attribute conflicts for a project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click Projects in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> dashboard.</li>
            <li>Select the project to view conflicts for.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Users</span> tab to view user attribute conflicts, or select the <span class="disableGlossary" style="font-weight: bold;">Groups</span> tab to view group attribute conflicts.</li>
        </ol>
