        <p> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> provides group management by optionally allowing a group of users in  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> who have been granted permissions on a project to be synchronized as a local system group to servers in that project.</p>
        <p>No additional configurations are added to  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" />-managed groups. These synchronized groups exist to support extensible configuration of permissions for users managed by  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> with external configuration management tools. When a group is granted admin rights on a project, those rights are managed independently of  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" />’s group management. It's not required to synchronize a group in order to grant admin rights to that group.</p>
        <p>By default, user groups in  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> are not synchronized to servers. This feature must be explicitly enabled for each group to be managed. A group is only synced to servers that are enrolled in the project(s) where you have enabled the sync flag for that group.</p>
        <p>Groups managed by  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> contain the server user accounts that correspond to the  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> users present in that group in the  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> platform.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">This feature is currently only available on systems running Linux.</p>

        <p>You can enable group management when you add a new group to a project or by editing a group that already belongs to a project.</p>
        <p>To enable group management when adding a group to a project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open an existing project from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> dashboard.</li>
            <li>Go to the <span class="uicontrol">Groups</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Add Group to Project</span>. The <span class="uicontrol">Add Group to Project</span> dialog appears.</li>
            <li>Select the group to add to the project from the <span class="uicontrol">Group</span> field.</li>
            <li>Select either <span class="uicontrol">User</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Admin</span> permissions to assign to the group.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Sync group to servers</span> to enable group management.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Create Group</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To enable group management for a group that belongs to a project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open an existing project from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> dashboard.</li>
            <li>Go to the <span class="uicontrol">Groups</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Click the gear <img src="../../../Resources/Images/asa/icon-gear.png" alt="gear icon" /> beside the group, then click <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>. The <span class="uicontrol">Edit Group for Project</span> dialog appears.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Sync group to servers</span> to enable group management.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Update Group</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Synchronized Group Name</h3>
        <h4>On Linux</h4>
        <p>To avoid naming collisions, groups created by the agent are prefixed with <code>sft_</code>. Groups created by  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> are assigned a GID on a per project basis incrementally, starting with <code>63001</code>. If the agent encounters a conflict with either the name or GID, it will attempt to take ownership of the conflicting group.</p>
        <h2>List managed groups</h2>
        <p>To see which groups in a project are managed by the agent:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the project to open.</li>
            <li>Select the project that contains the groups to list.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Groups</span> tab for the project.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Groups managed by the agent have a check mark in the <span class="uicontrol">SYNC&#160;TO&#160;SERVER</span>&#160;column.</p>
        <h2>Stop syncing a group to servers</h2>
        <p>Similar to enabling group management for a group, you can disable group management and stop syncing a group to servers. When you stop syncing a group, the group is deleted from the servers in the project and any users that were members of the group are also removed from the servers.</p>
        <p>To disable group management for a group that belongs to a project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the project to open.</li>
            <li>Select the project that the group belongs to.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Groups</span> tab for the project.</li>
            <li>Click the gear <img src="../../../Resources/Images/asa/icon-gear.png" alt="gear icon" /> beside the group, then click <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>. The <span class="uicontrol">Edit Group for Project</span> dialog appears.</li>
            <li>Clear the <span class="uicontrol">Sync group to servers</span> check box to disable group management.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Update Group</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Delete a group</h2>
        <p>When you remove a group from the project the group is removed from the servers in the project.</p>
