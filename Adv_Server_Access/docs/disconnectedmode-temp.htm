        <h2><a name="Use"></a>Gateways and High Availability in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /></h2>
        <p>To access gateways that are in a high availability (HA)&#160;group behind a load balancer when <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> is in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> requires that you activate <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> on each gateway in the group.</p>
        <p>For example, suppose you have a high availability group, HA, that contains three gateways (GatewayA, GatewayB, and GatewayC) that are behind a load balancer. Each gateway's configuration file sets AccessAddress to be the load balancer's public IP&#160;address.</p>
        <p>If you assigned a public IP&#160;address to each gateway, then you can activate <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> on each gateway by using sft dm activate as follows: </p><span class="codeblock">sft dm activate --group dm_group --gateway &lt;<i>GatewayA public IP&#160;address</i>&gt;:7234 --secret-file dm_group_2021-06-28.pem
sft dm activate --group dm_group --gateway &lt;<i>GatewayB public IP&#160;address</i>&gt;:7234 --secret-file dm_group_2021-06-28.pem
sft dm activate --group dm_group --gateway &lt;<i>GatewayC public IP&#160;address</i>&gt;:7234 --secret-file dm_group_2021-06-28.pem</span>
        <p>Alternatively, you can run <span class="code">sft dm activate</span> using the public IP&#160;address of the load balancer until <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> has been activated for every gateway in the group as follows:</p><span class="codeblock">sft dm activate --group dm_group --gateway &lt;<i>AccessAddress</i>&gt;:7234 --secret-file dm_group_2021-06-28.pem</span>
        <div class="note_cautionOkta">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/assets/Icons/Notes/Alert.png" class="noteImgFloat" title="Caution" alt="Caution" />
            <p class="noteContent">If you choose to use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> with gateways in a high availability group, you must ensure that you deactivate <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> for every gateway once normal service is restored.</p>
        </div>
        <p>As an alternative to only using gateways in a high availability group, you might also have an additional gateway, GatewayD, that's not part of HA, but has the same label that's used as a project selector for the gateways in the group.</p>
        <p>While GatewayD doesn't have the benefits of shared address load balancing that's used by the HA&#160;gateways, it does regularly communicate with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" />. If <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> fails to hear from GatewayD within five minutes, then the standard behavior of switching to a healthy gateway is followed. </p>
        <p>This approach simplifies activating <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> since only GatewayD needs to be activated, and there's no need to expose additional IP addresses. All of the gateways will be used for normal traffic, but GatewayD is solely responsible for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> traffic. If you want further redundancy when using <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" />, you can add additional gateways that aren't behind a load balancer, similar to GatewayD, and activate them when necessary.</p>
        <h2><a name="Best"></a>Best practices</h2>
        <p>The following are the best practices to follow when using <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" />:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Store activation keys securely.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If an activation key is lost or compromised, rotate the key.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Maintain a document that details the protocol of how to activate <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> for your team. This document should include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>A list of who's authorized to access the activation key.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>How a user without access to the activation key requests that <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> be activated, and how should the activator should verify the user's identity (for example, through a video call or some exchange of a shared secret).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The list of groups available in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> to a client is updated when the client's access token is refreshed. To force a refresh, log out of and log in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> using your client.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Periodically test that <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> works as expected for your team. Do this by activating <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" /> for one or more groups, have users who belong to those groups connect to servers in those groups using the client's <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" />, and deactivating<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Disconnected Mode" />. Perform this testing while <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> and <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> are both available.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
