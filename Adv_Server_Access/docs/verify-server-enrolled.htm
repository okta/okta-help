        <h1>Verify server enrollment</h1>
        <p>You can check if a server is enrolled in a project from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> dashboard or by running a command on a <span class="disableGlossary">client</span>.</p>
        <p>To check if a server is enrolled in a project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> dashboard.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Projects</span> and select the project where the server was enrolled.</li>
            <li>Go to the <span class="uicontrol">Servers</span> tab. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the server was successfully enrolled in the project, it appears in the list.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can check the enrollment by running the <span class="code">sft list-servers</span> command on the <span class="disableGlossary">client</span>. This command outputs a list of all enrolled servers. If the server was successfully enrolled, it appears in the list.</p>
