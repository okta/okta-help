        <h1>User management</h1>
        <p>Deploying <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> enables admins to perform user provisioning and lifecycle management across heterogeneous servers.</p>
        <p>These processes integrate with <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> by using SAML and SCIM to receive certain user properties and replicate them on managed systems. When user accounts already exist on a managed system, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> server agent attempts to reconcile them by taking the accounts and having <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> manage them.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> server agent does not just create or delete user accounts when it is installed or when changes are made to a user directory or to an RBAC permission that governs who can be given access to a system. Correct user account management is a core security outcome, so the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> server agent monitors the state of the managed system’s configurations by periodically polling with local read operations (for example, <span class="code">getent</span>). These periodic read operations against the system are low-impact on system resources (for example, memory and CPU)&#160;and are integral to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> being able to provide the security and resilience outcomes it's designed to achieve.</p>
