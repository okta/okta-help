        <h1>Client configuration</h1>
        <p>Use these advanced client configuration options to automatically share settings to clients that are logging into a server in a project. To use this feature ensure that these advanced client configuration features are enabled for your <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> team.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> client must be installed on each server where this advanced client configuration is performed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Forward Agent</h2>
        <p>Use this feature to forward a local SSH agent to the server you initially connected through <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" />.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From your <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd"></MadCap:variable> dashboard, go to <span class="uicontrol">Projects</span>.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="wintitle" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Details</span> tab, go to <span class="uicontrol">Client Configuration</span>.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Forward Agent</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Netcat Port Forwarding</h2>
        <p>Enabling this feature allows <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> to remotely execute Netcat (<span class="code">nc</span>) as a means of port forwarding instead of using the default  SSH port forwarding. Use this feature only if your server's version of SSH doesn't support port forwarding.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From your <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd"></MadCap:variable> dashboard, go to <span class="uicontrol">Projects</span>.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="wintitle" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Details</span> tab, go to <span class="uicontrol">Client Configuration</span>.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Netcat Port Forwarding</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Forward"></a>Forward Client Trust</h2>
        <p> The Forward Client Trust feature allows users to establish SSH sessions from their enrolled workstation into an enrolled server. They can also establish SSH sessions from that server into other enrolled servers. These subsequent connections, also called <span class="term">hops</span>, are performed automatically and allow lateral movement between two or more servers. In other words, server administrators can connect from one server to another without creating an entirely new connection from their workstations to subsequent servers. Users can hop between 64 different servers.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Forward Client Trust passes the client user's <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> access token to  the user's environment variable on the target server. That environment variable is then used by the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> client when connecting to other servers without requiring the user to perform a full SSO from that server.</p>
            <p class="noteContent">Given how the Linux operating systems work, it could be possible for another user logged-in with root-level access or permissive SUDOERS configuration to abuse their access and read another logged-in user's <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> access token.</p>
            <p class="noteContent">Before enabling this feature, you should understand the implications and accept the risk. Enabling this feature will also automatically update the <span class="filepath">sshd_config</span> file with the required settings. If other management tools manage the <span class="filepath">sshd_config</span> file, there could be a conflict. When enabling this feature, you should examine the <span class="filepath">sshd_config</span> changes it makes and incorporate those into your configuration management setup.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>From your <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> dashboard, go to <span class="uicontrol">Projects</span>.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="wintitle" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd">Details</span> tab, go to <span class="uicontrol">Client Configuration</span>.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">Forward Client Trust</span>.</li>
            <li>From your workstation, run the following command.<p><span class="code">sft login</span>.</p></li>
            <li>Log in to a server that has Forward Client Trust enabled.<p><span class="code">sft ssh &lt; SERVER 1&gt;</span>.</p></li>
            <li>Optional. Run <span class="code">sft list-servers</span>. You see a list of servers that you have access.                <div class="noteOkta"><p class="noteContent">Firewall rules may prevent the network connections regardless of the servers appearing in the list.</p></div></li>
            <li>From <span class="code">&lt; SERVER 1&gt;</span>, login to another server. <p><span class="code">sft ssh &lt; SERVER 2&gt;</span>.</p></li>
            <li>You can continue to hop from server-to-server as long as each additional hop has the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" /> client software already installed on it.</li>
