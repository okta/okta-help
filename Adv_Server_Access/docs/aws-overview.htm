            <h1>AWS server discovery</h1>
            <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/ea-banner.flsnp" />
            <p>AWS server discovery automates the process of discovering, managing, and removing <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Amazon Web Services" /> (AWS) cloud servers from an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> project. This functionality provides the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helps you identify newly provisioned AWS servers that aren’t yet protected by <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /></li>
                <li>Syncs your AWS inventory in near real-time so can always locate available servers</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Server discovery</h2>
            <p>AWS server discovery requires a team to connect one or more AWS accounts to an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> project. A daily server discovery job then runs for each cloud account and synchronizes the list of servers with AWS. These jobs run at the time that the cloud account was originally connected. For example, if a cloud account was connected at 12:30, the job would run every day at the same time. If multiple cloud accounts are connected, multiple jobs would run at different times for each account.</p>
            <p>If an unknown EC2 instance is found, a new server is added to the connected <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> project. After the server is discovered, admins must still install the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> server agent. During this installation, admins can use an enrollment token to add the server to a different project.</p>
            <p>While a team can add multiple AWS accounts to a single project, a single AWS&#160;account can't be shared between multiple projects. After being connected to a project, the AWS account can't be associated with any other <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> teams or projects.</p>
            <p>Servers can’t belong to multiple projects. If a server is already enrolled in a project, the server discovery job skips adding the server to the current project. Also, if <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> can’t locate a previously discovered server, it’s removed from the available project inventory.</p>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is required for server discovery and cloud auto-enrollment to work correctly.</p>

            <h2>Real-time sync</h2>
            <p>Real-time sync allows <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> to subscribe to compute instance events generated by AWS. These events commonly occur when a compute instance is launched or terminated. Normally, server discovery happens daily, but real-time sync can add or remove when <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> receives a notification.</p>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">It may take up to ten minutes before server changes are synchronized with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" />.</p>
