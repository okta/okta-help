        <h1>Service users</h1>
        <p>Service users enable you to grant permissions to your automation to
    access specific operations in     <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" />, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enabling trusted services to be granted access to your infrastructure</li>
            <li>Integrating with the
      <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> API to automatically add users to <span class="disableGlossary">groups</span></li>
            <li>Retrieving audit events from the
      <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> API to store in your ELK setup</li>
            <li>Building other custom integrations with the
      <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> API</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can add service users to <span class="disableGlossary">groups</span> and grant them the same permissions as regular users. The main difference
    between a user and service user is how they authenticate.</p>
        <p>While users are pushed from
    <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, which handles their authentication, each service user is
    given a pair of credentials that are used to generate a short-lived
    authentication token to be used with the API.</p>
        <h2>Authentication</h2>
        <p>In order to authenticate as your service user to the
    <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> API, you will need to create an
    API key. The API key is a pair of strings known as the ID and secret.
    You will need both to authenticate, which generates an authentication
    token that is sent with each request you make.</p>
        <h2>Create a service user and an API key</h2>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../snippets/create-service-user.flsnp" />
        <h2>Expire a service user API key</h2>
        <p>Immediately upon expiring an API key, any requests that use a token generated using the key are prevented from succeeding.</p>
        <p>To expire the API key of a service user:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> dashboard, click <span class="uicontrol">Users</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Service Users</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Click the name of the service user whose key you want to expire. The service users details page appears.</li>
            <li>Click the gear <img src="../../../Resources/Images/asa/icon-gear.png" alt="gear icon" /> next to ID&#160;of the expiring key. Click <span class="uicontrol">Expire Now</span>. The <span class="uicontrol">Expire API&#160;Key</span> window appears.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Expire</span> to expire the API key ID, or click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/asa/icon-window-close.png" alt="x button" /> to cancel the operation.</li>
        </ol>
