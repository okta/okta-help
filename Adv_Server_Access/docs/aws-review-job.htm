            <p>After a team connects an AWS account to a  project, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> attempts to discovery available servers created within AWS. This server discovery job runs at the same time the cloud account was originally connected. For example, if a cloud account was connected at 12:30, the job would run every day at the same time. If multiple cloud accounts are connected, multiple jobs would run at different times for each account.</p>
            <p>Teams can review the actions related to each individual job from within the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> console. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Access the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ScaleFT" /> admin console.</li>
                <li>Go to the Projects page and open the project connected to the AWS account.</li>
                <li>Go to the <span class="wintitle">Enrollment</span> tab and open the connected AWS account.</li>
                <li>Go to the <span class="wintitle">Run History</span> tab.<br /></li>
                <li>
					Optional. Click <span class="uicontrol">View details</span> to download a .csv file that outlines the specific job details.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each job is listed on this page. From here, teams can quickly review the when a sync job ran and any outcomes of the job. Teams can review specific actions for each job by downloading the associated .csv file.</p>
