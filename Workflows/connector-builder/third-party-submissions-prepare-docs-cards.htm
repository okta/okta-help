        <h1><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> action card documentation</h1>
        <p>Every card in a connector needs a help topic to describe the purpose and  the fields of the card.</p>
        <h3>Name and description</h3>
        <p>Clearly indicate the name of the card and provide a brief description describing the action  performed by the card. This information can match the name and description section of the action flow associated with the card. </p>
        <h3>Field definitions</h3>
        <p>Include information for every option, input, and output field on the card. For every field, provide the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Label</span>: The name of the field.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Definition</span>: Describe the purpose of the field, such as the data to be passed to or returned by this field.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Type</span>: Specify the type of data allowed for this field. For example, <span class="uicontrol">Number</span> or <span class="uicontrol">List of Text</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Required</span>: Indicate whether this field needs a value to run the flow.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Organize all options, inputs, and outputs as separate sections.</p>
        <p>For options, the group name is labeled <span class="wintitle">Options</span> and can't be changed. For the options fields described in the help topic, list all available choices.</p>
        <p>For inputs and outputs, all fields are located within one or more groups, with changeable labels. Include all group labels in the help topic.</p>
        <h3>Limitations and known issues</h3>
        <p>Include information about any limitations and known issues for that card. For example: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A card  executes slowly if it has to process a large set of records</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A dropdown for an options field can only display a subset of all possible choices</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
