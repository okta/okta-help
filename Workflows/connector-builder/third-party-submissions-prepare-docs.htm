        <h1><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> submission documentation</h1>
        <p>Every <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> connector requires user documentation, and it must be included as part of the connector submission. The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network" /> checks your documentation as part of the verification process. </p>
        <p>After your connecter is published and made available in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" />, you can set the access level for your documentation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>General:&#160;any person can view your content.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Customer only: if you want to keep your connector docs private, configure a sign-in method on your site so that only approved customers have access.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>Your content should cover the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>How to configure and use your connector</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Understanding the input and output fields of your connector's action cards</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> How to anticipate and address any performance issues for flows that contain one or more of your action cards</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">The connector documentation must explicitly state the version number of the connector that it covers. When you release a new version of your connector, update your documentation with the new version number and highlight any new features.</p>
        </div>
        <p>When a user clicks the help icon on a connector card or  dialog, a pop-up window displays a link to your externally hosted help documentation. </p>
        <p>User documentation for your connector can be in any format, but generally speaking you should use one of the following: HTML, <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Google Docs" />, Microsoft Word document, or a PDF.</p>
        <p>Your documentation set needs to include the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="third-party-submissions-prepare-docs-auth.htm">Authorization</a>
            </li>
            <li>Help topics for <a href="third-party-submissions-prepare-docs-cards.htm">every action card</a></li>
            <li>A help topic for any <a href="third-party-submissions-prepare-docs-capia.htm"><span class="wintitle">Custom API Action</span> card</a></li>
            <li>Optionally, any help topics for troubleshooting, FAQs, or other guidance for your connector and its cards</li>
        </ul>
