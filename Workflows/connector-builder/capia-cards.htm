        <h1>Custom API Action (CAPIA) cards</h1>
        <p>Custom API Action cards allow a connector to scale in front of development efforts.  They provide users the ability to hit any endpoint for an API, even if you haven't built out a specific action. For OAuth, this is dependent on the enabled scopes.  CAPIAs don't provide the added usability of a standard Workflows card, and much of the complexity that connectors abstract is left to the user to define.</p>
        <p>A CAPIA-only connector includes three or four flows, depending on the service’s auth type and endpoints: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>httpHelper</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Custom API Action</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>_authping</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>_revoke (token based services only)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
