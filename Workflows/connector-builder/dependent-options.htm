        <h1>Add dependent options to an action card</h1>
        <p>Options of the type <span class="wintitle">Helper Flow</span> can be dependent on other options that are defined in the <span class="wintitle">Options</span> dialog.</p>
        <p>For example, assume you are creating a card with two options fields, both of which are dropdowns, and they are named <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Issue Type</span>. The <span class="uicontrol">Issue Type</span> dropdown will be populated with values only after the user selects a project from the <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> dropdown. Because the <span class="wintitle">Issue Type</span> helper flow requires a  selection in the <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> field by the card user, the <span class="uicontrol">Issue Type</span> option is “dependent” on the <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> option. The Jira connector Create Issue action card contains the same design.</p>

        </p>
        <p>For the <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> dropdown, add a helper flow and name it <code>Get Available Projects</code>. This helper flow makes a request to the service to return a list of projects that are available to the user of the card. To build the child flow and format the response, see <MadCap:xref href="options-dialog.htm">Add option fields to connector cards</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>To display the values in the <span class="uicontrol">Issue Type</span> dropdown, you first need to determine which value was selected from the <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> dropdown by the user. Create a second helper flow and name it <code>Get Issues Type by Project ID</code>, and include an input field named <span class="uicontrol">Project ID</span>. </p>
        <p>This helper flow makes a request to the service to return a list of issue types available based on the project selected by the card user.  When the <span class="uicontrol">Issue Type</span> option is created, and the Get Issue Types by Project ID flow is selected, the dialog will detect the <span class="uicontrol">Project ID</span> input defined on the helper flow card and allow the input to be mapped to the value that was retrieved from the <span class="uicontrol">Project</span> option.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When the card is deployed, the second flow will wait until the user makes a selection before it runs.</p>
