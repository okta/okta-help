        <h1>Rename or delete a connector</h1>
        <p>The left Connectors pane lists all of the connector projects in your environment. From the gear menu icon for each connector, you can rename the project or delete it. </p>
        <p>To rename a project, select Rename from the gear icon menu and add a new project name in the <span class="wintitle">New Connector Name</span> dialog.</p>
        <p>To delete a project,  select Delete from the gear icon menu, then click <span class="uicontrol">Delete connector project</span> in the confirmation dialog. The following criteria must be met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The project has never been deployed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The project contains zero flows.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The project contains zero connections.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a project doesn't meet any of these conditions, a warning dialog appears and you'll be prevented from deleting the project.</p>
