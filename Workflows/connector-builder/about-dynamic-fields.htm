        <h1>Dynamic dropdown, fields, and groups</h1>
        <p>Connector Builder provides the ability to dynamically return a list of dropdown options, a list of input or output fields, and list group properties.</p>
        <h2>Dynamic dropdowns</h2>
        <p>Options are often added as dropdown fields on a card. They determine how an action card will interact with a third-party service. Dynamic dropdowns offer the flexibility of returning different data sets based on the third-party service account that is used when creating a connection. These are often used when end users of an application can add their own record types or fields. For example, dynamic dropdowns on the Create Issue action card for the Jira connector determine the types of issues that can be created and the projects against which new issues can be added.</p>
        <h2>Dynamic fields</h2>
        <p>Dynamic inputs and outputs fields can be  retrieved from a third-party service or modified in the connector flow based on selections by the card’s end user. They often include custom fields that are specific to a third-party account and are defined directly in that service. For example, a Create User card for a service may include standard fields such as Username and User ID, but may also include custom fields from an instance of an application.</p>
        <h2>Dynamic groups</h2>
        <p>Dynamic groups allow connector developers to use a helper flow to return the group name and extensibility option (group properties) along with a list of fields and field properties.  This option should be used when either the group name or extensibility option may change based on which Options a user selects on a card.  For example, if a card’s Options are used to select between searching for a User or searching for a Group, then dynamic groups can be used to clarify the inputs or outputs provided on the card.</p>
