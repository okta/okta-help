        <h1>Connections</h1>
        <p>Connections are saved credentials that can be used to simplify the testing of flows. For many services, it is good practice to test your flows using multiple sets of credentials. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Test connections for Connector Builder count against an org's connections limit and cannot be deleted. There is no limit to the number of connections that can be saved for a connector project.   </p>
        <p>Builders can create a new connection from the Test dialog when testing their flow.  They can also choose from a list of previously created connections.  When creating a new connection, it is good practice to give it a distinct nickname that includes information about which credentials have been used.  For example, <code>Jonathan - Developer account basic</code>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish"> In the coming months, builders will be able to create connections while building out their authentication and manage those connections on a Test Connections tab.</p>
        <p>Builders can create and save connections to use when testing their connectors.  After clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Test</span> button while building a flow, a <span class="uicontrol">Create a test connection</span> link will display in the test dialog.  Clicking on this link will run the authentication defined in the connector project.</p>
