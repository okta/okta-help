        <h1>Extensible input fields</h1>
        <p>When an action card is designed to allow extensible fields, a Workflows user can add fields to a card when building a flow. Such fields are not defined by you when building your connector and action cards in Connector Builder. Instead, they are defined by a user on the card in Workflows Designer. </p>
        <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Extensible Inputs</span> toggle, when turned on, allows a Workflows user to add as many fields to a card as needed to suit their flow. For each new field, the user adds a a string value for the key and an input value.</p>
        <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Extensible Inputs</span> toggle is turned off by default. Extensibility is available for dynamic input fields only. </p>
