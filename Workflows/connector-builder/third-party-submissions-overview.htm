        <h1><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> submissions</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> connector can be submitted to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network" /> (<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" />) for review and publication. By publishing your connector to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" />, you gain visibility in a public marketplace. Other <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> customers can view and deploy any connectors created through the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" />. </p>
        <p>Submitting a connector to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> requires a review process to confirm that it meets <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />'s quality assurance standards for publication. Any connector available to the general public must meet the following objectives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Developed according to <MadCap:xref href="best-practices.htm">Best practices in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /></MadCap:xref></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Doesn't negatively affect <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> platform performance </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Includes help topics for each action card, including <span class="wintitle">Custom API Action</span> cards</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Executes as expected according to the provided help documentation</p>
            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
                <p>Meets all basic security standards</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team reviews submitted connectors on a best-effort basis. There are no service level agreements in place around connector submissions. After you submit your connector, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team will contact you with an estimated time frame for the review and publication process.</p>
        <p>After it's approved for publication, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> deploys the connector to preview cells for a one week trial period before being deployed to production cells. </p>
        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>As part of the evaluation, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team expects  the submission to be made by an official account. This account needs to have legal access to the associated platform and any APIs used in the connector. It can be directly associated with the company, or through a subsidiary business or a contractor of the company. </p>
        <p>If the account isn't clearly associated with the company (typically through the email domain),  the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team requests proof through an email from a domain that matches the connector, or from a particular owner at the company.</p>
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>For the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> testing process, you need to provide the following items when submitting your connector.</p>
        <h3>Support contact</h3>
        <p>Provide an actively monitored email address for customer support. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> publishes this email address as part of your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> catalog entry.</p>
        <h3>Escalation contact</h3>
        <p>You  also need to supply an escalation contact address. The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team uses this address for any issues encountered during the testing process, or if there's an issue with a published connector. This escalation email isn't made available publicly.</p>
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>You need to have technical documentation that describes the proper use and configuration of your connector. See <MadCap:xref href="third-party-submissions-prepare-docs.htm"><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> submission documentation</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Okta doesn't host the documentation for your connector, so it must be available from your own domain or a publicly accessible third-party site. You can keep this content private during the review process, and then coordinate with the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team to make your documentation public when <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> publishes your connector.</p>
        <h3>Test environment</h3>
        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team needs a valid account or tenant where they can test your connector. This test tenant should have enough sample data to properly evaluate the connector. For example, if the test connector uses pagination, then you must have enough samples so that the connector can return multiple pages of data.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">The test data must not contain any personally identifiable information (PII). Don't use real or pseudonymous profile data.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Provided test credentials should have all the necessary permissions to test the endpoints implemented by your connector.</p>
        <h3>Test guidance</h3>
        <p>You also need to provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A list of test cases, detailing the actions performed by your flows. See <MadCap:xref href="third-party-submissions-test-details.htm">Prepare connector documentation</MadCap:xref> for specific requirements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A copy of your test flows, exported as a <span class="filepath">folder</span> file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A link to any API&#160;documentation associated with the connector. This can be public or private, as long as the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" /> team can access these API&#160;docs using the provided test credentials.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
