        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>The flows used to make a connector are built almost entirely of functions.  At a high level, functions are used for manipulating and generating data that gets passed between the connector and service being integrated.  The functions menu is split into several categories within the product, such as Branching, Error Handling, Text, Object, JSON, and Encryption.</p>
        <p>For a full list of functions that are available in Connector Builder, see <MadCap:xref href="../function-reference/functions.htm">Functions in Workflows Connector Builder</MadCap:xref>.</p>
