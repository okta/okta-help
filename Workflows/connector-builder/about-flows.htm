        <h1>Flow types in Connector Builder</h1>
        <p>There are three main types of flows that you can use as building blocks in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" />:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:xref href="#Action">Action flows</MadCap:xref>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:xref href="#System">System flows</MadCap:xref>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:xref href="#Helper">Helper flows</MadCap:xref>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Action"></a>Action flows</h2>
        <p>Use action flows to create action cards that allow end users to perform an “action” against a service, to address their business use cases or automate common processes. </p>
        <p>This is the only flow type in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> which users can use to build flows on the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> platform. Use action flows in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> to build action cards such as <span class="wintitle">Custom API Action</span>, <span class="wintitle">Create User</span>, or <span class="wintitle">Search Files</span>.</p>
        <h2><a name="System"></a>System flows</h2>
        <p>Another flow type in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" />  is the system flows that form the foundation for  a connector and that connector's action cards. System flows are similar to actions, but these are hidden from users and are used only by the platform.</p>
        <h3>Authping</h3>
        <p>The <span class="term">authping</span> flow is one such system flow. The authping flow checks the connection for a connector. It's used to verify that a particular card is connected and communicating with the external third-party service.</p>
        <h3>Revoke</h3>
        <p>Another system flow is the <span class="term">revoke</span> flow. This flow allows you to revoke a connection's access token. </p>
        <p>Revoking the token prevents the token from remaining active, even after the token is deleted from the Workflows platform. This keeps  anyone  from viewing the permissions granted to Workflows in an external application's third-party access listing. </p>
        <p>By implementing a revoke flow, users can revoke an access token from the <span class="wintitle">Connections</span> page or from any card belonging to that connector.</p>
        <h3>Webhook events</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/workflows/webhook-intro-1.flsnp" />
        <p>A&#160;webhook event flow often includes a registration and a deregistration event for subscribing to the external service.</p>
        <h4>Webhook registration</h4>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/workflows/webhook-reg-intro-2.flsnp" />
        <h4>Webhook deregistration</h4>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/workflows/webhook-dereg-intro-2.flsnp" />
        <h2><a name="Helper"></a>Helper flows</h2>
        <p> In addition to action and system flows, helper flows  are called by other flows within your connector project.  They can be used for many purposes, like iterating through a data set or for performing shared tasks such as authorization.</p>
