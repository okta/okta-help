        <h1>Deploy your connector privately</h1>
        <p> When your connector is working and tested, you can deploy a version to your local org for further testing or internal production use.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Previously, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> designated this type of deployment as a local connector.</p>
        </div>
        <p>To deploy a tested version as your private deployment version, click the <span class="wintitle">Actions</span> menu for that version and select <span class="uicontrol">Deploy version</span>. </p>
        <p>When you deploy a test version of a connector, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> disables the <span class="uicontrol">Deploy version</span> action to prevent any additional attempts. The <span class="wintitle">Private deployment</span> section displays a loading icon to indicate that the deployment is in progress. </p>
        <p>Most deployments only take a few minutes to complete. However, if an error occurs during in the deployment process, and it remains incomplete after 30 minutes, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> re-enables the <span class="uicontrol">Deploy version</span> action.</p>
        <h3>Deployment details</h3>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Private deployment</span> section contains the details of the current private deployment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Deployment date</span>: When this version of the connector became the private deployment version</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Version deployed</span>: The version of the connector</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Deployed by</span>: Who deployed this version of the connector</p>
            </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
                <p><span class="wintitle">Usage</span>: The number of times this connector is used in flows within your org</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Visibility</span>: A privately deployed connector is <span class="uicontrol">Visible</span> in your org's flow builder by default. </p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">If you click the icon and change the visibility to <span class="uicontrol">Hidden</span>, then users can't add this connector to their flows. However, any existing flows that added your deployed connector when it was still visible can still call it.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click the <span class="uicontrol">View history button</span> to see a version history page for all private deployments of this connector.</p>
        <h3>Switch between versions</h3>
        <p>To deploy a different test version as your private deployment version, click the <span class="wintitle">Actions</span> menu for that version and select <span class="uicontrol">Deploy version</span>. </p>
        <p>This option allows you to switch between any valid version of the connector. </p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">If you revert to an earlier version of the connector for your private deployment, the newly deployed version doesn't affect existing flows. This means that any users who implemented the previous version retain that version in their flows. Notify users with the incorrect version so they can update their flows.</p>
