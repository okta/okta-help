        <h1>Test your connector</h1>
        <p>This area shows all the versions of a connector created by you or your team for a specific project. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> gives each new version of the connector an incremental version number.</p>
        <p>Any icon displayed after the version number indicates the state of the connector:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col style="width: 83px;" />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td style="text-align: center;vertical-align: middle;">

                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Private deployments of the connector use this test version of the connector.</p>
                        <p> If you click the icon, the state changes to <span class="uicontrol">Hidden</span> and this version of the connector is hidden.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
                    <td style="text-align: center;vertical-align: middle;">

                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p>Private deployments of the connector are hidden from use. </p>
                        <p>If you click the icon, the state changes to <span class="uicontrol">Visible</span> and this version of the connector is available to use.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Workflows/connector-builder/deployment-warn.png" />
                    </td>
                    <td>There are errors or warnings detected in the validation test for this version of the connector. Click the icon to see specific warning messages.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>This area only displays test versions that pass the validation process, unlike the previous version of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" />. If a test version fails the validation process, the error dialog shows the issues, but <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> doesn't retain any details about that test version.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">If you deploy a new version that breaks existing flows, then <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> keeps the resulting error in the test version table for you to review.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Each row also displays the creation date and the team member who created it. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">You can add any information relevant to a specific version in the editable <span class="wintitle">Note</span> column.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">The <span class="uicontrol">Find a version</span> text field allows you to enter search terms to find a specific test version of your connector. </p>
        <h3>Create test version</h3>
        <p>To create a version of your connector for testing purposes, click <span class="uicontrol">Create test version</span>. This action makes a new copy of the connector, so you can make changes and tweak settings while  still keeping an existing  version of the connector privately deployed.</p>
        <h3>Validate connector</h3>
        <p>After making any changes, you can test the connector for errors without having to deploy the connector to a local environment. This step confirms that the connector contains the necessary components for a successful deployment, such as at least one action flow and a unique name for each flow.</p>
        <p>When you click <span class="uicontrol">Validate connector</span>, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.ConnectorBuilder" /> checks the latest version of the connector. A dialog indicates if the connector is valid or has errors. See <MadCap:xref href="cb-validation-errors.htm">Connector Builder deployment validation errors</MadCap:xref>.</p>
