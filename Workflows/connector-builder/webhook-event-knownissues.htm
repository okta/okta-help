        <h1>Known issues and limitations for webhook event flows</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Using a static input to pass to the registration flow is recommended. This enables you to reuse the registration flow in all  the webhook event cards you want to define. The static input on the webhook registration card should map to an option value on the webhook event card. For example, this value can consist of an internal key for the resource to be monitored.</p>
                <p>However, if you have a third party service that allows webhook events for custom resources with multiple potential values, using the option values is preferable. Then you can reuse this single event card to select any dynamic resource.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A user can create a webhook event card using subscriptions if they only have a registration flow. The deregister flow isn't required. However, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> recommends that you include both. Without a deregistration flow, a user must manually revoke the webhooks through the third party service.</p>
