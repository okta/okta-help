        <h1>Connector Builder</h1>
        <p>For beta, Okta is targeting the feature set necessary to create Custom API Action cards.  CAPIAs allow Workflows users to make authenticated HTTP requests to a single service, and help you avoid much of the hassle of using the HTTP functions by coding the base url into the connector and saving/managing the auth context.  GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests types will all be supported.</p>
