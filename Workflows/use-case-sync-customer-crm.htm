            <h1>Sync customer identities with CRM and marketing tools</h1>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Problem: To track and engage consumers, add Okta-managed customer identities into marketing and CRM tools such as Salesforce and Marketo. While some apps have out-of-the-box integrations for provisioning, they are more often oriented towards managing user information, not leads or contacts.</p>
            <p>Solution: Like workforce provisioning and deprovisioning use cases, use Workflows to create, update, and delete contacts in a third-party tool when specific lifecycle events occur. For example, when an Okta profile is registered, updated, or deleted, a lead is created, deleted or deactivated, or specific lead details are updated in Marketo.</p>
            <p>Example Applications: Salesforce, Marketo, Hubspot, and Shopify. For the full list of available Workflows connectors, see <MadCap:xref href="connector-reference/connector-reference.htm">Connectors</MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <h2>Guidelines and limitations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This type of solution is recommended for steady-state synchronization of data and full imports.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>At high volumes, be aware of daily event hook limits, and downstream API rate limits. Flows may slow or fail if they are rate-limited by a downstream provider. Workflows system-wide limits also apply. See <MadCap:xref href="workflows-limits-learn-about.htm">Learn about Workflows Limits</MadCap:xref>.</p>
