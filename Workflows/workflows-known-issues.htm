                <h1>Workflows known issues</h1>
                <p>Be aware of known issues within Workflows.</p>
                <h2>Access to Workflows</h2>
                <p>For Workflows to perform properly, you must have the SSO&#160;SKU&#160;enabled. Visit the <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/">Okta Help Center</a> or contact Okta support.</p>
                <h2 MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Flow import and export across environments</h2>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Flow packs cannot be imported across different environments (for example, oktapreview.com and okta.com).</p>
                <h2>Spreadsheet functions</h2>
                <p>Certain connectors use polling to trigger events. For example, the New Row function for Google Sheets is one such event. Because of polling, these events may not trigger immediately upon changes, but may take 10 minutes or more before the Flow is activated after a change.</p>
                <h2>Connector event and action limitations</h2>
                <p>Workflows memory limits affect the number of items that may be shown in dynamically generated connector drop-downs. For example, in the Okta connector, for any events or actions that use a drop-down list of applications, only the first 100 applications can be displayed.</p>
                <h2>Unsupported authentication types</h2>
                <p>Workflows does not support OAuth 2.0 client credentials for authentication in flows.</p>
                <h2>On-premises applications</h2>
                <p>Workflows does not support connections to on-premises third-party applications.</p><span class="wintitle">&#160;</span>
