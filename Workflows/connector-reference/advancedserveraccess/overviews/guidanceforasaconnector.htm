                <p>You can perform CRUD operations on the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Projects</p>

                        <p>ASA Users and Groups</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pre-Authorizations</p>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Additionally, for API operations that are not directly supported by the pre-built cards, you can use the Custom API Action card to invoke arbitrary API calls against the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" /> API.</p>
                <p>Your use of the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" /> connector and its action cards assumes a basic understanding of <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" /> terminology, components, API, and interface. Developer documentation is an essential resource to use when developing flows to understand the various actions and properties of the cards. For the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" /> API, see <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/asa/introduction/">Introduction to the Advanced Server Access API</a>.</p>

                        <p>The <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" /> connector does not support all <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" /> API endpoints.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Note the difference in behavior in updates to the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Advanced Server Access" /> connector and connections in Workflows. ASA administrators are responsible for managing the service user account that is used by the connector to authenticate to ASA.</p>
