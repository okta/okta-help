            <p class="noteContent">Due to third-party API&#160;limitations, this event card doesn't monitor workbooks that are stored in OneDrive shared libraries. Flows are triggered for workbooks that are stored in personal OneDrive storage only.</p>
            <p class="noteContent">If a workbook is moved from personal OneDrive storage to a shared library, the Microsoft API may continue to return the data for the version of the file at the time when it was moved. If the file is moved back to personal storage, the Microsoft API may return data for both the original file and the updated file after it was moved back to  personal OneDrive storage.</p>
