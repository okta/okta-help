            <p class="noteContent">Due to third-party API&#160;limitations, this action card doesn't update workbooks that are stored in OneDrive shared libraries. Updates are limited to workbooks stored in personal OneDrive storage.</p>
            <p class="noteContent">If a workbook is moved from personal OneDrive storage to a shared library, the Microsoft API may continue to return the data for the version of the file at the time when it was moved. If the file is moved back to personal storage, the Microsoft API may return data for both the original file and the updated file after it was moved back to  personal OneDrive storage.</p>
