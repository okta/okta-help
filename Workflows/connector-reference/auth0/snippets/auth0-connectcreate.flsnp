        <p>When you add an <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Auth0" /> card to a flow for the first time, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> prompts you to configure the connection. This creates a connection to your <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Auth0" /> account, and also saves your account information so you can reuse the connection for any new flows that include <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Auth0" />.</p>
