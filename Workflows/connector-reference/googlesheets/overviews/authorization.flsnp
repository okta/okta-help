        <p>When you add a <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Google Sheets" /> card to a flow for the first time, you'll be prompted to create a configuration. This will allow you to connect to your account, save your account information, and reuse that configuration next time you build a flow with the connector. By doing so, you don't have to authenticate every time you want to build a flow with this connector. Instead, use the configuration you have already set up.</p>
        <p><span class="uicontrol">Note:</span> You can create and save multiple configurations and share them with your teammates.</p>
        <p><span class="uicontrol">Note:</span> You can create multiple connections and manage them from your Settings page.</p>
        <p>To create a new connection from an Event or Action card:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">New Connection</span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter a <span class="uicontrol">Connection Nickname</span> for your <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Google Sheets" /> account. Make the nickname unique if you plan to connect multiple accounts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Create</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
