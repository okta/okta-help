    <body>This dropdown displays a maximum of 300 accounts. Choose from the list of available AWS accounts or select <span class="code">-- Enter Account ID --</span> to enter an ID that doesn't appear in the list.<p><span class="uicontrol">Note:</span>&#160;While the root account does appear in the list of available accounts, the Account ID can't be that of the root account. The root account requires additional permissions associated with the policy that's attached to the customer's role. Disallowing the use of the root account prevents users from providing unnecessary permissions to root.</p></body>
