            <p class="noteContent">Actions that involve adding or removing AWS entitlements take some time to be processed by AWS. This processing time means that the list of entitlements returned by List AWS Entitlements may not reflect all of the entitlements that were added or removed. Additionally, a conflict error can be returned if a remove entitlement action immediately follows an add entitlement before the entitlement was successfully added.  To avoid unwanted side effects, you can insert a delay in your flow by using a Wait For function, with a suggested delay time of 30 seconds. This connector will try to complete its task a finite number of times before returning an error if unsuccessful.</p>
