            <p class="noteContent"><MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Freshservice" /> users don't necessarily have the same access rights as one another. The ability to access data depends on the permissions set for a <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Freshservice" /> profile. If some expected fields for a card don't appear, this could be a sign that the user is lacking a permission. See <a href="https://api.freshservice.com/v1/#authentication" target="_blank">Authentication</a> for more information on access rights.</p>
