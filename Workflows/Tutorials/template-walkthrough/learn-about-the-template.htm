                <h1>Step 2: Learn about the flow template</h1>
                <p>The Flow Chart is a high-level view of the template. Each icon represents an event, an action, or a function.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/Workflows/Flow_Chart.png" alt="Flow Chart" />
                </p>
                <h2>User Assigned to Application</h2>
                <p>The event card is User Assigned to Application. This means that the flow is triggered whenever a user is assigned to the designated application in Okta. If you’ve already connected your Okta accounts, click <span class="uicontrol">Choose Connection</span> and select the one you want to use. If you haven’t connected an account, see <MadCap:xref href="../../connector-reference/okta/overviews/authorization.htm">Authorization</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>Whenever this flow is triggered, the event card will generate the following values as output:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">ID</span>: unique identifier for the AppUser, Okta User, or AppInstance</li>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">Alternate ID</span>: userName for the AppUser or Okta User, or the customizable AppInstance name for an Application</li>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">Display Name</span>: name of the AppUser or Okta User, or the default application name for an Application</li>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">Type</span>: User, AppUser or AppInstance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For details, see <MadCap:xref href="../../connector-reference/okta/events/useraddedtoapplicationmembership.htm">User Assigned to Application</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <h2>Search Users</h2>
                <p>The first action card is Search Users. If you’ve already connected your Salesforce accounts, click <span class="uicontrol">Choose Connection</span> and select the one you want to use. If you haven’t connected an account, see <MadCap:xref href="../../connector-reference/salesforce/overviews/authorization.htm">Authorization</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                <p>The output of the event card is used to search users in Salesforce. The AppUser’s Alternate ID is mapped from the Okta event card to the <span class="uicontrol">Username</span> input field on the Salesforce card. If the user is found in Salesforce, their Salesforce User ID and Is <span class="code">Active?</span> status will appear in the <span class="uicontrol">Result</span> fields.</p>
                <h2>Read User &gt; Lookup &gt; Lookup &gt; Create User</h2>
                <p>This branch of the flow is part of the If/Else function. If the User ID is <span class="code">null </span>in the Search Users card, the user does not exist in Salesforce.</p>
                <p>The Read User card fetches the entire Okta User output.</p>
                <p>The first Lookup card checks the user’s department and assigns a Salesforce profile. You can change the mapping and edit the assignments, but remember that in an Okta profile, Department is case sensitive.</p>
                <p>The second Lookup card assigns Salesforce feature licenses. You can change the mapping and edit the assignments, but remember that in an Okta profile, Department is case sensitive.</p>
                <p>The Create User card generates a new Salesforce user ID based on the Read User output (<span class="uicontrol">First Name</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Last Name</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Username</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Email</span>) and the Lookup output (<span class="uicontrol">Profile</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Feature Licenses</span>).</p>
                <h2>Continue If &gt; Activate User</h2>
                <p>This branch of the flow is part of the If/Else function. If the User ID is not <span class="code">null</span> in the Search Users card, the user already exists in Salesforce. The flow then determines whether the user is active.</p>
                <p>If the Is Active? field is <span class="code">False</span>, the flow continues to the Activate User card.</p>
                <p>If the Is Active? field is <span class="code">True</span>, the flow generates an output message of <span class="msgblock">User was found active</span>.</p>
