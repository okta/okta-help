            <h1>Step 3: Trigger the flow in Okta</h1>
            <p>Now that you understand how the flow works, let’s see it in action. In this task, you’re going to manually assign a user to Salesforce, either by individual or group assignment. You’ll need to navigate between your Workflows Console, your Okta Admin Console, and your Salesforce tenant, so be sure that you have completed the steps in <a href="before-you-begin.htm">Before You Begin</a>.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the Workflows Console, toggle the <span class="uicontrol">Flow is OFF</span> button to <span class="uicontrol">ON</span>. If you haven’t saved your flow yet, you are prompted to name and save it. </li>
                <li>In the Admin Console, assign a user to Salesforce. See <a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-assign-apps.htm">Assign applications to users</a> or <a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-assign-app-group.htm">Assign a single app to groups</a>. The flow is triggered automatically when that assignment occurs.</li>
                <li>Return to the Workflows Console and open Flow History. Select the executed flow to see its results.</li>
                <li>Navigate to your Salesforce tenant and confirm that the user was created.</li>
            </ol>
