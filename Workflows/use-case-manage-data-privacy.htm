            <h1>Manage data privacy requests</h1>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Problem: Under GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy regimes, customers have a right to have their data retrieved or deleted (or both) by service providers. These requests are typically highly manual and time-consuming, and failure to comply with them can lead to steep penalties.</p>
            <p>Solution: Tools like DataGrail can automate the process of discovering and retrieving customer data. Okta Workflows can call out to these tools based on identity events, such as user inactivity or a user being in a particular group.</p>
            <p>Applications: <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.DataGrail" />. For the full list of available Workflows connectors, see <MadCap:xref href="connector-reference/connector-reference.htm">Connectors</MadCap:xref>. </p>
