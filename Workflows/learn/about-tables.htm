            <h1>Tables</h1>
            <p>Tables are a convenient way to store data that can be read from or written to a flow.</p>
            <p>Instead of using spreadsheets or database applications that may require authentication or cause delays, tables allow you to aggregate important data and ensure that it persists across your flows.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Tables let you simply and securely store data&#160;across flow executions without external services or additional credentials required. </p>
            <p>You can use tables in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Build flows with greater context:</span> You may have a flow that processes incoming&#160;customer requests and adds information to a table for&#160;customers who require special follow-up. The flow can check to see if it's the second&#160;request that week for a customer and decide to take&#160;immediate action. A different flow can run each Monday morning to assign the remaining&#160;customer requests.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Track and report on data that passes through flows:</span> You can&#160;keep a running count of specific events or store individual transactions to include in a monthly report to management.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Create a lookup table or share constants across flows:</span> Often with provisioning use cases, you may need a way to map a user's department to the role that's needed for a particular system. Or you might need a customer table for&#160;the IDs used by different cloud services so your flows know how to look up the same customer in different places. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
