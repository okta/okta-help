            <h1>Low-latency flows</h1>
            <p>Every workflow requires a certain duration to complete. The total time required is composed of two factors: the time spent waiting for the flow to execute and  the actual  execution time. 

</p>
            <p>While the execution time of the flow generally remains constant from one execution to the next, the queuing time depends on several factors:
</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Latency inherited from the network and throughput limitations of the systems that execute the flow. 
</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Latency inherited from sharing the standard execution mode with other flows. These other flows may be processing queries involving large amounts of data or complex flow configurations.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
The Low-latency feature ensures consistent execution times for your flows by running flows that meet a specific set of criteria separately from those that don't. See <MadCap:xref href="about-low-latency-criteria.htm">Criteria for low-latency flows</MadCap:xref>.

</p>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> routes low-latency flows to an optimized processing queue with minimal wait times and increased resource availability. These flows execute at a higher velocity compared to flows that run in standard mode or flows that get throttled. See <MadCap:xref href="about-execution-limits.htm#FlowThrottling">Flow throttling</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <p>For example, the following graphic illustrates how flow  execution queues look before the release of the Low-latency feature:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Workflows/low-latency-before.png" alt="Idealized processing queues for flow execution, showing low latency eligible flows being stuck behind throttled and standard rate flows." />
            </p>
            <p>In the previous configuration, flows that would be eligible for low-latency mode are being held up by large or throttled flows. These low-latency flows must wait until these longer-duration flows are complete.</p>
            <p>After the release of the Low-latency feature, the flow execution queues would look like the following:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Workflows/low-latency-after.png" alt="Idealized processing queues for flow execution, showing low latency eligible flows in their own queue, no longer halted behind throttled or standard rate flows." />
            </p>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> moves all the low-latency eligible flows moved into their own queue, removing them from the constraint of being behind large or throttled flows in the queue. The low latency flows execute at a higher and more consistent velocity, improving your business processes.</p>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <p class="noteContent"> If <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> detects that a low-latency flow no longer meets the low-latency criteria, the flow  returns to the back of the regular flow queues.
