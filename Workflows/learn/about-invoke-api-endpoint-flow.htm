            <h1>Invoking an API endpoint flow</h1>
            <p>API Endpoint flows are flows that can be triggered from an outside source. Unlike flows that start with events associated with an application, these flows can be triggered at any time, so long as the client is hitting the appropriate endpoint with the appropriate security setting.</p>
            <p>The client calling the endpoint causes the flow to execute and the client receives back the output of that execution of the flow.</p>
            <p>You can expose this API endpoint in two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Exposed as a Webhook</span>: A flow exposed at this security level will only be able to be accessed if the client making an <code>invoke</code> / <code>resume </code>/ <code>retry </code>request is passing along the proper client token along with the proper invoke URL (which includes a flow alias). For more information about client tokens and flow aliases, see <MadCap:xref href="about-flow-client-token.htm">About a flow client token</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="about-flow-alias.htm">About a flow alias</MadCap:xref>.</li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Exposed as a Public Service</span>: A flow exposed at this security level will be available to anyone with the invoke URL. This invoke URL is built off of the flow alias.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You change how you want to expose an API endpoint from the <span class="uicontrol">API Endpoint Settings</span> dialog.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve decided how you want your API Endpoint to be properly exposed, you may then invoke the flow.</p>
