            <h1>Cards in flows</h1>
            <p>
                Each card represents one specific step in a flow. Within a card, there are input and output fields. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Input fields accept values. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Output fields are the values produced by that card. Other subsequent cards can then use these fields as input. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">Configure a connection to the third-party application and select any relevant <span class="wintitle">Options</span>. This is required before you can access the <span class="wintitle">Input</span> and <span class="wintitle">Output</span> fields of an action card.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The ability for an action card to accept inputs and then return a different output is one of the most powerful features of Workflows. You can chain multiple cards together and map outputs to inputs. This enables you to build flows that transform data, use logic to decide on next steps, or perform follow-up actions using that data.</p>
            <h2>Input fields</h2>
            <p> The input field values determine how the action or function card should proceed. </p>
            <p>For example, the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Gmail" /> <span class="wintitle">Send Email</span> card has input fields for <span class="uicontrol">To</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Subject</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Body</span>. For the text <span class="wintitle">Replace</span> function, there are input fields for the string to <span class="uicontrol">look in</span>, what text to <span class="uicontrol">look for</span>, and what text to <span class="uicontrol">replace with</span>.</p>
            <h2>Output fields</h2>
            <p>A flow assigns values to the output fields after running an event, action, or function. </p>
            <p>For example, the text <span class="wintitle">Replace</span> function has a field called <span class="uicontrol">result text</span> that contains the new text string composed after the function makes the replacements. For the <span class="wintitle">New Issue</span> event in <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Jira" />, there’s an output for the <span class="uicontrol">Issue ID</span> of the newly created issue.</p>
            <p>A key feature of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> is this ability to map the output field from one step to the input field of another step. </p>
            <p>For example, you can drag the <span class="uicontrol">Email Address</span> output from a <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Marketo" /> <span class="wintitle">Read Lead</span> action card and drop it onto the input field of an <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Office 365 Mail" /> <span class="wintitle">Send Email</span> action card. Every time the flow executes, the flow uses the email address for that specific customer  as the destination address for the email.</p>
            <h2>Other card options</h2>
            <p>Along the bottom of each card, there's a set of buttons with available options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Help</span>: Click the "?" icon to view help content specific to that card.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Test This Card</span>: Allows you to provide sample input values and see the resulting output. This option is available only for action and function cards.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Run When</span>: Set your event to trigger once for all new records, once for each new record, or only when no new records are found. This option is available only for application events. See <MadCap:xref href="../build/set-monitor-options.htm">Set data exchange options</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Schedule Options</span>: Control how often to check for new data or run the flow. This option is available only for non-webhook application events and scheduled events.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Endpoint Settings</span>: Choose a security level and provide the URLs used to invoke the endpoint. This option is available only for <span class="wintitle">API Endpoint</span> event cards.</p>
                </li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Form Settings</span>: Provide the details for accessing the form, either through a URL or by embedding it into a page. This option is available&#160;only for <span class="wintitle">Form</span> event cards.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Filter Fields</span>: Filter the view to only display fields that match the filter text. This option is useful for cards with many fields, such as a <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Salesforce" /> record.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There's also a gear icon for <span class="uicontrol">Other options</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Edit card</span>: In customize mode, you can rename or reorder fields, or even rename the card. See <MadCap:xref href="../build/customize-card.htm">Customize a card</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Choose fields</span>: Set which fields appear on the card. This is useful for cards that have possibly hundreds of fields, but only a few that you need.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Error handling</span>: Show error options, such as automatic retry or running an error handling flow if the card fails. See <MadCap:xref href="../build/set-error-handling.htm">Set error handling</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
