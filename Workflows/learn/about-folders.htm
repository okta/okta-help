        <h1>Folders and subfolders</h1>
        <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> console, the <span class="wintitle">Flows</span> page uses folders and nested subfolders to organize your flows and tables. </p>
        <p>The structure provided by folders and subfolders helps you to create meaningful differentiation among various projects.  When you can quickly reference folders and their contents, you can better visualize relationships between related flows and tables.</p>
        <p>Folders and subfolders are sorted alphabetically. Top-level folders and subfolders have the same basic attributes and functionality.</p>
        <h2>Folder tasks</h2>
        <p>You can create, rename, import, export, and delete folders and subfolders from the <span class="wintitle">Flows</span> page of your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> console.</p>
        <h3>Create a top-level folder</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Workflows/flows-addnewfolder.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" /> <span class="uicontrol">Add folder</span>  in your side navigation bar.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter a name and an optional description for the folder. </p>
                <p>When naming folders and subfolders, establish a system that aligns to your needs. Begin with project-level concepts for top-level folder names and then use more granular, task-specific names for subfolders. Capitalize folders consistently for readability.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Create a subfolder</h3>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">While there's no limit to the number of subfolders you can create, the maximum folder depth (including the top-level folder) is five levels. </p>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>After creating or opening a folder, click the <span class="uicontrol">Actions</span> dropdown menu and select <span class="uicontrol">Create subfolder</span>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter a name and an optional description for the folder. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>An alternative method to create the subfolder is to click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Workflows/flows-addnewsubfolder.png" /> <span class="uicontrol">Add subfolder</span> from a folder in the side navigation.</p>
        <h3>Rename a folder</h3>
        <p>If your folder structure or naming conventions change at any point in the future, you can rename the folder. </p>
        <p>Also, you can add or edit the folder description with details such as test results, deployment status, or other information pertinent to the flows and tables inside the folder.</p>
        <h3>Import a folder</h3>
        <p>You can use the import and export actions  to move flows, tables, and subfolders to a new <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> organization. You can also use these actions to duplicate a folder within the same organization. </p>

        <h3>Export a folder</h3>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/workflows/export-folders.flsnp" />
        <h3>Delete a folder</h3>
        <p>Deleting a folder removes all flows and tables for that folder, including any contained within subfolders.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Deleting a folder is irreversible. Back up any flows, tables, table data, or other information that you want to keep before deleting the folder.</p>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open the folder that you want to remove and turn off all flows in the folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the <span class="uicontrol">Actions</span> dropdown menu, click <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span>. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Confirm your intent by typing  the name of the folder.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
