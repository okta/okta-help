            <h1>Action cards</h1>
            <p>Action cards for applications control various aspects of the application or web service. They cause an action to happen, such as sending a message, adding a record, or updating an existing record. Action cards can retrieve information from the application by searching for records, or looking up customer information, or even downloading a file.</p>
            <p>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Add app Action</span> to choose the application with which you want to work, such as <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Salesforce" />, <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Slack" />, or <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Gmail" />. </p>
            <p>After choosing the application, the next step is to select an action card for that application. Each third-party application has a unique set of action cards, based on the application's capabilities and features.</p>
            <p>See <MadCap:xref href="../connector-reference/connector-reference.htm">Connectors</MadCap:xref> for a complete list of the available third-party connectors and their action cards.</p>
