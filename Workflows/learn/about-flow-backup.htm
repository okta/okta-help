        <h1>Back up flows and folders</h1>
        <p>With flow back up, you can treat your flows like source code. You can perform regular backups, create versions, and import flows.</p>
        <p>To start using the flow back up, several other artifacts are available to facilitate this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Export Flow</span> and <span class="wintitle">Export Folder</span> function cards</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Create Pull Request</span> action card for the <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.GitHub" /> connector, so you can make commits and create pull requests in <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.GitHub" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Templates that you can import into your Workflows environment. These templates demonstrate how to version flows by making a direct commit to <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.GitHub" /> or creating a pull request. The templates demonstrate backing up a single flow, but you can modify them to support the back up of multiple flows within a folder.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
