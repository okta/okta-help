            <h1>Flows and tables</h1>
            <p>From the <span class="wintitle">Flows</span> page, you can access all the folders, flows, and tables that are in your Workflows instance. </p>
            <p>The <span class="wintitle">Flows</span> page uses a left-hand navigation bar to organize all available folders. After you select a folder in the navigation tree, the main page displays two tab-based panes:&#160;<span class="wintitle">Flows</span> and <span class="wintitle">Tables</span>.</p>
            <h2>Flows</h2>
            <p>To create a flow and add it to the current folder, click <span class="uicontrol">+ New Flow</span>. To search for a flow, enter your search text into the search field beside <span class="uicontrol">+ New Flow</span>.</p>
            <p>You can view all the available flows inside a folder using either a list or tile view. </p>
            <p>In the list view for the <span class="uicontrol">Flows</span> tab, the following information is shown listed for each flow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">TYPE</span>: The type of flow. A flow can be an application event, an API Endpoint, a scheduled event, or a helper flow. See <MadCap:xref href="about-parent-flows.htm">About parent flows</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="about-helper-flows.htm">About helper flows</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">ON/OFF</span>: Ready-access ability to turn a flow on or off. A flow can start running only after it's  turned on.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">NAME</span>: A user-provided label for the flow.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">ACTIONS</span>: A visual summary of the connectors that are used in the flow. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">HISTORY</span>: A visual summary of successful executions and failed executions for the flow, along with the last time that the flow was executed. A green check indicates the number of successful executions. A red 'X' indicates the number of failed executions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">AUTHOR</span>: The username for the account that created the flow.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">DATE CREATED</span> or <span class="uicontrol">LAST EDITED</span>: The date when the flow was created or last updated.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For each flow, you can edit the name and description of the flow. You can also test, duplicate, export, or delete the flow by clicking the matching icon (in tile view)&#160;or the action from the settings  menu (in list view).</p>
            <h3>Sort flows</h3>
            <p>In the list view for flows, you can click the column headers to sort the flows  in ascending or descending order. This is true for any of the column headers except <span class="wintitle">HISTORY</span>.</p>
            <p>In the tile view, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> presents flows as tiles including the flow's name and text description. Use the dropdown menu to sort the tiles using any of the available options, in either ascending or descending order.</p>
            <h2>Tables</h2>
            <p>To create a table and add it to the current folder, click <span class="uicontrol">+ New Table</span>. To search for a table, enter your search text into the search field beside <span class="uicontrol">+ New Table</span>.</p>
            <p>Similar to the flows tab, you can view all the available tables inside a folder in either a list or tile view. </p>
            <p>In the list view for the <span class="uicontrol">Tables</span> tab, the following information is shown for each table:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">NAME</span>: A user-provided label for the table.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">RECORDS</span>: The number of lines in the table. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">AUTHOR</span>: The username for the account used when the table was created.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">DATE CREATED</span> or <span class="uicontrol">LAST EDITED</span>: The date when the table was created or last updated.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For each table, you can edit the name or description, duplicate the  table, or delete it.</p>
            <h3>Sort tables</h3>
            <p>In either list view or tile view, you can sort tables  in ascending or descending order using any of the four criteria for tables.</p>
