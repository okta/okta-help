            <p>The triggering event and the resulting actions in your use case are linked through connectors, functions, and mapped input and output values.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Connector</span> - Which applications are involved in your flow?  Connectors enable you to interact with them without manually configuring APIs. </li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Function</span> - Functions allow you to interact with, change, or control the data in your flow. Typically, a Function card is placed between Action cards.</li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Connection</span> - A connection is your unique level of access  to the connected app (for example, admin or end user).  </li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Input</span> - Input fields determine how an action or function card proceeds. For example, the input field on the Search for User action card might be the <span class="uicontrol">Email address</span> field.</li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Output</span> - Output fields contain the results that are generated by the event, action, or function card. For example, a <span class="wintitle">User Unassigned from Application</span>  event card might produce output values such as <span class="uicontrol">Date and Time</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Message</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Event ID</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Event Type</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Event Time</span>. </li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Mapping</span> - The movement of data between cards is referred to as mapping.&#160;To map data between cards, drag and drop the output field of one card to the input field of another card. Be sure that the format of the fields match (text, number, true/false, date &amp; time, object, or list).</li>

            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Optional"></a>Optional elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Notes</span> - Notes explain the flow or set reminders. You can add them between events, actions, or functions without affecting the run-time process.</li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Templates</span> - A template is a copy of a flow created by Okta that fulfills a use case with minimal configuration. </li>
