            <h1>Numbers and text</h1>
            <p>When you're adding, subtracting, splitting, or concatenating inputs, the manipulation of both numbers and text is a critical piece of building an automation. Number and Text functions are two of the more common function types of functions that are used when building a Flow.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">In many programming languages, functions are defined as procedures or routines that accept an input and return a new output. With Workflows, this same definition applies. There are a number of different Function categories, and in each category, there are Function cards that provide different capabilities.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">The categories of available functions include functions to control how your Flow runs, such as <span class="uicontrol">Branching</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Error Handling</span>, functions to manipulate the different types, such as <span class="uicontrol">Text</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Number</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Date &amp; Time</span>, and advanced functions to for <span class="uicontrol">HTTP</span>, <span class="uicontrol">JSON</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">URL</span> actions.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish"> Math and Text functions are two of the more common libraries that are used when building a Flow.</p>
            <h2>Number Functions</h2>
            <p>Number functions are used to perform common math operations, such as Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.</p>
            <p>In addition to these basic functions, there are other more complex functions available, such as Round, Remainder, and Factorial. See <MadCap:xref href="../function-reference/functions.htm">Functions</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <h2>Text Functions
        </h2>
            <p>Three of the most important text functions are Find, Text Segment, and Compose.</p>
            <p><span class="uicontrol">Find</span> allows you to search inside text. This can be useful if you’re looking for a specific text (this function will return an output field of “-1” if the text is not found). If the text you're trying to find exists, the position where it is found will be returned as the output.</p>
            <p><span class="uicontrol">Text Segment</span> allows you to extract a portion of text by specifying the start and end locations within the text. Use <span class="uicontrol">Text Segment</span> to get a very specific section of text. This may be a word, a character, or a series of words and characters.</p>
            <p><span class="uicontrol">Compose</span> is one of the most useful text functions. It allows you to create any message and includes the ability to drag inputs into the message. The compose card supports both HTML and Markdown.  This is functionally similar to the Concatenate function.</p>
