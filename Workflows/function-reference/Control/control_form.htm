            <h1>Form</h1>
            <p>Starts a flow whenever a custom web form is submitted. The form is automatically generated using the fields that are added to the card.</p>
            <h2>Step 1: Create a field&#160;for each input you want on the form</h2>
            <p>Each custom field that you create on the card will result in an input&#160;field added to your&#160;custom form. They look like output fields on the card (that can be used to map values to later steps in your flow). But, after step 2, you'll be able to preview the actual form or access it via a web page.</p>
            <p>For each field, use the type dropdown to configure&#160;the form inputs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="userinput">Text</span> - appears&#160;as a text input box on the form</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="userinput">Number</span> -&#160;like a text input box, but only accepts valid numbers</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="userinput">Date</span> - appears as a date picker control on the form</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="userinput">True/False</span> - appears as a checkbox on the form</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="userinput">File</span> - appears as a file picker on the form, with a "Choose File" button</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="userinput">Customize...</span> - &#160;gives access to changing the display name as well as optional default value and optional help text. The display name shows up as the form control label (e.g. the text of the checkbox). Optional help text appears as a non-bold subtitle beneath the label.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step 2: Save and Turn On the flow</h2>
            <p>Once you've saved and turned on the flow, you'll be able to preview your form by clicking the "form" link at the top of the card or the "Form Settings" button on the bottom. You'll be give a URL that leads to the form or the iframe snippet to embed the form in an existing web page.</p>
            <h2>Step 3: Build the rest of your flow</h2>
            <p>The flow will run each time you click <span class="uicontrol">Submit</span> on the form and will pass all of the input values. Drag and drop your form fields to later steps in the flow to run actions or functions on those&#160;values.</p>
            <p>Use&#160;a <MadCap:xref href="../Flow-Control/flocontrol_return.htm">Return</MadCap:xref> card at the end of your flow to display one or more values to the form user when the flow completes. For example, show a custom message and/or calculated results.</p>
            <p>In addition to the form fields, all Form cards have one additional output field, named <span class="uicontrol">Execution ID</span>, that does not appear on the form. It's assigned a unique value every time a new form is submitted.</p>
