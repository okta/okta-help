            <h1>Filter Custom</h1>
            <p>Given a list, the Filter Custom function creates a new&#160;list that contains only those&#160;items in the list that pass a&#160;test. The test is done by calling a helper flow once for each item. The flow&#160;returns true or false, as to whether that item should be included in the output list. To filter using a simple comparison test, use the Filter function instead.</p>
            <p>To use this function, first build the helper flow that you will use to test&#160;each item.&#160;This helper flow will be invoked once for each item in the list.&#160;Define fields on&#160;the&#160;event card that will be the inputs that feed into the test. Typically you will&#160;include a field&#160;for the item of the list.&#160;You can also include other inputs that your flow will need&#160;to perform the test. Then build the rest of the helper flow, ending with a Return card that returns a single value of the true/false type -- either True (to include that item in the resulting list) or False (to not include it). The name of the true/false field on the Return card doesn't matter. Save the flow&#160;and turn it on.</p>
            <p>Now go back to the Filter Custom card and select the flow you just built. The inputs will auto-populate, then you can map data into them.&#160;To map an input to accept&#160;each item of the list, click in that field and you will see a drop down that includes&#160;<span class="uicontrol">Item</span> - select that. Or if your list is a list of objects, you may also see the schema of the object, i.e. the keys that it contains, and&#160;you can also build your helper flow to accept those as inputs.&#160;In addition, you can drag in outputs&#160;from previous cards in the flow -&#160;in that case, the same value will be used&#160;for each item in this list.</p>
            <h4>Input Fields</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">list:</span> Input list that contains all of the items you will test</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">flow</span>: Helper flow that will be called once for each item in the list</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">with the following values</span>&#160;(dynamically generated): Inputs defined by the helper flow - these will populate after&#160;you select the helper flow using the <span class="uicontrol">Choose Flow</span> dialog</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">concurrency</span>: Number&#160;of items in the list to process in parallel. If it is important that the items are processed in sequence, use 1.&#160;Otherwise&#160;a higher number like 5 or 10 will cause your flow to complete sooner.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Output Fields</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">list:</span> Output&#160;list that contains&#160;only those items that passed the test, as determined by the provided helper flow.</li>
            </ul> </div>
