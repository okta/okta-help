            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Problem: Limit, monitor, or adjust stages of the end customer journey based on consent information, and store such data in third-party systems for auditing or other purposes. Track and manage multiple versions of terms and conditions and adjust access accordingly.</p>
            <p>Solution: Write consent data to a third-party tool such as OneTrust by way of a REST API or store it in Universal Directory. Track a user's consent state and drive follow-up actions with notifications or tickets. Workflows can also store a reference to various terms and conditions. And manage access to content based on a state of a user's consent through group membership.</p>
            <p>Example Applications: OneTrust. For the full list of available Workflows connectors, see <MadCap:xref href="connector-reference/connector-reference.htm">Connectors</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <h2>Sample Flow 1</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Customer registers → Read data subject in OneTrust → Read consent / T&amp;C version from OneTrust → Write to profile or update user’s group</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">User added to group → Continue if group is Consent related → Get consent metadata for specific version from table → Send notification to use or admin</p>
            <h2>Guidelines and limitations</h2>
            <p>Tables in Workflows have limited administrative functionality.</p>
