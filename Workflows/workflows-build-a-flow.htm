            <h1>Build and test a flow</h1>
            <p>
		Use the drag-and-drop interface in the Workflows console to build your own flows. Each event and action in a flow works with a pre-built connector, which  allows you to communicate with other applications without code or APIs. Simply connect your applications, specify the event and actions, and fill in the details.</p>

            <p>Before you build a flow, perform these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Learn about cards and fields in a flow. See <MadCap:xref href="workflows-elements.htm">Elements of a Workflow</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a connection for the Okta connector. See <MadCap:xref href="workflow-connect-your-applications.htm#Authenti">Authenticate your Okta account</MadCap:xref>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Optionally, create connections for other applications in your flow. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2><a name="Build"></a>Build a flow</h2>
            <p>This procedure covers the basic sequence of commands to build a flow. After you learn the mechanics, try building some flows for real-world use cases. See <MadCap:xref href="use-cases-workflows-learn-about.htm">Learn about Okta Workflows use cases</MadCap:xref>.</p>

If you haven't connected the app yet, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> prompts you to make the connection.&#160;Action-specific help  is available in the console by clicking the question mark icon<img src="../../Resources/Images/workflows_help.png" />.</p>

                            <p>Function cards act on the data from a card or branch into another logical flow. You can choose a logic function, like branching or error handling, or you can choose a function that manipulates data, like a compose card, a list, or a table. You can even choose advanced functions that make HTTP&#160;requests or parse JSON&#160;strings. However, you don't select an app for a function card. Function-specific help is available in the console by clicking the question mark icon<img src="../../Resources/Images/workflows_help.png" />.</p>

                    <p>Or, if you want to manually test your flow, click the <span class="uicontrol">Save and Test</span> option from the <span class="uicontrol">Add Another</span> menu.</p>

            <p>There are two ways to test a flow: you can manually enter data into the event card, or you can trigger the event in the app itself. If you chose the <span class="uicontrol">Save and Test</span> menu option, proceed to step 2 of the manual method.</p>
