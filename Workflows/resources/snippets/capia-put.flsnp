    <body>Sends data to be stored at a specific location on a web server based on parameters (for example, uploading a file). Unlike POST requests, PUT requests are idempotent. For successful requests, the result of a single PUT request is the same as many identical PUT requests. If a request is successful, a <span class="code">200 (OK)</span>, <span class="code">201 (Created)</span>, or <span class="code">204 (No Content)</span> response message is returned.
