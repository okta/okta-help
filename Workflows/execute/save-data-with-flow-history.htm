            <h1>Save flow data</h1>
            <p>If you enable the <span class="uicontrol">Save all data that passes through the Flow</span> feature, <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Okta" /> starts saving the flow data each time the flow executes. This data retention is useful when you need to check prior executions or to debug flow errors.</p>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> retains data for each execution for 30 days. However, you can delete all data from the execution history at any time. See <MadCap:xref href="clear-all-data-flow-history.htm">Clear all saved data</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <div class="note_cautionOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">Use caution when working with flows that contain sensitive data.</p>

            <h2>Clear saved data</h2>
            <p>You can delete all execution data collected for your flow. The <span class="wintitle">Execution History</span> page still displays the list of flow executions, showing the success or failure and the date and time of each execution. However, the data that passed through the flow is no longer available.</p>

                <p>Example 1</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flow A has the saving data feature turned on.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flow B has the saving data feature turned off. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the flow executes, Flow A calls Flow B. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Result:&#160;Flow Histories for both A&#160;and B&#160;are saved because A&#160;is the root flow for the execution.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example 2</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flow F has the saving data feature turned off.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flow G has the saving data feature turned on. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The flow executes with Flow F calling Flow G. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Result:&#160;Flow Histories aren't saved for either flow, because F&#160;is the root flow for the execution.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example 3</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flow J has the saving data feature turned on.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Flow K has the saving data feature turned off. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The flow executes with Flow J calling Flow K, which in turn calls Flow L. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Result:&#160;Flow Histories are saved for all three flows, because J&#160;is the root flow for the execution.</p>
