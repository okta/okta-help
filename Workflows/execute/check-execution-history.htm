                <h1>Check execution history</h1>
                <p>You can check on a flow after it has run and view every input and output field value for every stage in your flow. By doing so, you can confirm that a flow is running properly and to determine where an error may be occurring.</p>
                <p>Data for an executed flow is available to view for 30 days.</p>
                <p>To use this feature, open a&#160;flow that has run and click on the <span class="uicontrol">Flow History</span> tab. Click on an item in the list displayed in the right pane to see the data that passed through the flow for a particular execution.</p>
                <p>Since flows can be used to process personally identifiable information, you must opt in to saving Flow History. Flow History can be enabled in two ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Check the <span class="uicontrol">Save all data</span> checkbox in the Save dialog. This can be accessed when first saving the flow or by reopening the dialog by clicking on the flow's name.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click on the <span class="uicontrol">Enable Save Data</span> link in the right pane of the Flow History page.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>To stop saving Flow History for a flow, open the <span class="uicontrol">Save</span> dialog, click the flow name and uncheck the <span class="uicontrol">Save all data</span> checkbox.</p>
                <p>To clear data from a flow history, see <MadCap:xref href="clear-all-data-flow-history.htm">Clear All Data in Flow History</MadCap:xref>.</p>
