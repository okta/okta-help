                <h1>UnknownError - Errors</h1>
                <p>An "Unknown Error" will result when a call to an application or other API&#160;returns&#160;an error with no message included.</p>
                <p>A good way to get to the bottom of errors like this is to go to Flow History and click the execution that resulted in the unknown error. You should see a red error box on the card where the error occurred and inside that box will be the full details that were returned&#160;along with the error. Sometime, those details will include an error description and/or other details. That information plus knowing the card where the error occurred provide the first clues in how to track down the issue.</p>
