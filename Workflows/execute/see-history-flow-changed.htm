            <p>When you click a record in the <span class="wintitle">Execution History</span> pane, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />&#160;shows a view of the flow with the actual values used for that particular execution. </p>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">This view is available only if there's accessible data for a record. The save data feature must have been active when the flow executed. See <MadCap:xref href="save-data-with-flow-history.htm">Save flow data</MadCap:xref>. Also, you can't see data that <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> removed after the 30-day retention limit. </p>
            </div>
            <p>However, if the flow itself has changed since that prior execution, the values&#160;may no longer show correctly:</p>

                    <p>There will be no values shown for any cards or fields added after the execution.</p>

                    <p>For any cards that were moved, the values show in the new position.</p>
