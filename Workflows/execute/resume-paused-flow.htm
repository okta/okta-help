            <p>Before pausing or resuming your flow, make sure that the security settings are correct. For more information about setting security levels on an API Endpoint flows, see <MadCap:xref href="../learn/about-invoke-api-endpoint-flow.htm">About invoking an API endpoint flow</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <p>Once your security level is appropriately set, you have two options to resume your flow, depending on your security setting.</p>
            <div class="note_cautionOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">To resume your flow using either option, you must pass along an execution ID. You can get this ID from the flow's execution history, or under the <span class="uicontrol">context</span> object that is returned when you invoke a flow.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="note_cautionOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">A flow cannot be resumed if it is nested within any card. </p>
            </div>
            <h2>Exposed as a Webhook</h2>
            <p>To resume a flow as an exposed Webhook:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the API Endpoint Settings dialog, copy the URL that is in the <span class="uicontrol">Resume URL</span> field.</li>
                <li>Perform a GET/POST on that URL, depending on if you need to pass along data in the body of that request. The URL also requires an execution ID. </li>
                <li>If the client token is not appended to the URL that's in the <span class="uicontrol">Invoke URL</span> field, pass along the client token as a query parameter.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Exposed as a Public Service</h2>
            <p>To resume a flow as a public service:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the API Endpoint Settings dialog, copy the URL that is in the <span class="uicontrol">Invoke URL</span> field.</li>
                <li>Perform a GET/POST on that URL, depending on if you need to pass along data in the body of that request. The URL also requires an execution ID. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Upon resuming the flow, you'll get back the final output of your flow as the response. Additionally, the rest of the flow will run as normal when resumed.</p>
