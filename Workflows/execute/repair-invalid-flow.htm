            <h1>Repair an invalid flow</h1>
            <p>You can't save a flow that has an invalid structure. Three typical causes of invalid flows are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Required inputs not present</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Invalid isolated method</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Invalid fields</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Invalid error handling</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Required inputs not present</h3>
            <p>Required inputs are&#160;marked with a red asterisk next to the field name. Scan all your cards to make sure that you've assigned a value to all required inputs. </p>
            <p>If your flow has branches (for example, if it uses an <span class="wintitle">If/Else</span>) you should look inside the branches as well. Any invalid card typically shows a red title.</p>
            <h3>Invalid isolated method</h3>
            <p>Sometimes an <span class="msgblock">Invalid isolated method</span> alert appears&#160;on several, or even all, of the cards in your flow. </p>
            <p>This error usually results when a field is mistakenly mapped from the right to the left. You may have to search through all of your cards to find the error. To help locate these kinds of errors, you can turn on the X-Ray view. Click the X-Ray button found at the right side of the toolbar above your flow.</p>
            <p>For example, consider the scenario of a flow with a <span class="wintitle">Math Add</span> card that sums the outputs of two previous cards. If you move&#160;the <span class="wintitle">Math Add</span> card to the left of one of those two source cards, then <span class="msgblock">Invalid isolated method</span> alerts appear. Moving the <span class="wintitle">Math Add</span> card back to a point after the source cards removes the alerts.</p>
            <h3>Invalid fields</h3>
            <p>The <span class="msgblock">Some fields are invalid</span> alert happens if you map a field from inside a branch  to a card outside of the branch. </p>
            <p>For example, mapping the <span class="uicontrol">False</span> branch of an <span class="wintitle">If/Else</span> to a later card. This is invalid because that field doesn't exist if a different branch is run. </p>
            <p>The alert goes away if you move the destination card inside the same branch as the source field. Or, if you want to use fields from inside a branch to the outside, use branch <span class="uicontrol">Outputs</span> to assign a value from each branch that does map to later steps.</p>
            <h3>Invalid error handling</h3>
            <p>If your flow contains error handling that isn't valid, then the flow can't be saved or executed. </p>
            <p>For example, if you select the <span class="uicontrol">Run another flow</span> option in the error handling for a card, but you don't enter a helper flow where the Workflows can return the error details. This sequence means that the error handling for the card is invalid, and so you can't save the flow. </p>
