            <h1>Flow limits</h1>
            <p>Every Workflows tenant is subject to the consumption limits of the subscribed flow plan. </p>
            <p>An admin is allowed to run a maximum number of active flows according to these tiers and their suggested use cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Workforce Identity" /> Free Trial: A 30-day free trial plan that includes five active flows to get started with Workflows, with a maximum of 1,000 executions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Workflows Starter: A free plan with five active flows to get started with Workflows.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Light Workflows with 50 active flows: A cost-based plan for lightweight identity automation (for example, of on-boarding and off-boarding, or to connect backend customer systems).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Medium Workflows with 150 active flows: A cost-based plan to automate processes for multiple employee, contractor, and customer systems.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Unlimited active flows: A cost-based plan to automate processes across an entire enterprise.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <span class="wintitle">Usage</span> page lists the number of active and inactive flows in a Workflows tenant, and the number of tables, connectors, and connections  that are available.</p>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">If you have a legacy Workflows entitlement (for example, from Advanced Lifecycle Management), then your org is limited to 100 active parent flows as part of a cost-based plan to automate processes for multiple employee, contractor, and customer systems.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To upgrade your plan to a higher tier flow limit, contact your Okta representative.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">A request can be submitted to Okta Support to increase the maximum limit of the number of flows that is assigned to a tenant.</p>
