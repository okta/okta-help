                <h1>Set schedule options</h1>
                <p>When you create a new scheduled flow, you are prompted to provide a schedule. Polling monitors default to checking every five minutes. You can change the schedule at any time by clicking the clock icon that appears at the bottom of an event card.</p>
                <p>The <span class="wintitle">Flow Schedule</span> dialog includes several options:</p>
                <h2>Frequency</h2>
                <p>Choose a division of time for scheduling your flow. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Minute</span>: Choose a number of minutes from the dropdown (for example, <span class="uicontrol">15</span> to run every 15 minutes). You can optionally set a time range restriction (for example, just run between 9am and 5pm) and/or specific days (for example, only weekdays).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Hour</span>:&#160; Choose a number of hours (for example, one to run every hour). As with Minutes, you can specify a time range restriction and specific days. The default is to run <span class="uicontrol">on the hour</span>&#160;or you can specify an exact number of minutes after the hour.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Day</span>:&#160; Choose the time to run the flow every day.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Week</span>:&#160; Choose the time and day(s) to run the flow every week.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Month</span>:&#160; Choose the interval (for example, 3 for every 3 months), time, and which day to run each month - either a specific day number or a specific day of the week.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Advanced Options</h2>
                <p>Specify <span class="uicontrol">Exact</span>&#160;minutes to run after the hour for granular control over timed schedules.</p>
                <h2>No earlier than</h2>
                <p>Choose to start when the flow is turned on, or on a specific date.</p>
                <h2>No later than</h2>
                <p>Choose to end when the flow is turned off, or on a specific date.</p>
                <h2>Timezone</h2>
                <p>Specify the timezone to use for the schedule.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Summary </span>field displays the selected scheduling options in sentence form.</p>
                <p>Maker sure to click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span> to make changes. </p>
                <p>Once the flow is turned on, a countdown timer will appear in the flow's header pane indicating when it will run next.</p>
