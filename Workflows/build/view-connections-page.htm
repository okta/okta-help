            <h1>Connections page</h1>
            <p>You can view and update connections for your flows on the <span class="wintitle">Connections</span> page.</p>
            <p>The following information is listed for each connection to a cloud app that you've already set up:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name of the application. For example, <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Slack" /> or <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Google Drive" />.</li>
                <li>Nickname for the specific application. This is useful when you have multiple connections for a single app.</li>
                <li>User who added the connection.</li>
                <li>Creation date for the connection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can manage an existing connection with a handful of tools: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="uicontrol">Rename Connection</span>:&#160;Change the name of the connection.</p>
                </li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Test Connection</span>: Validate that the connection is working.</li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Usage</span>: See which flows are using a particular connection.</li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Reauthorize</span>:&#160;If you update the password, API key, or another setting for an application, you need to reauthorize your application. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Reauthorize</span> icon and follow the steps to update your connection. Be sure to reauthorize each connection to the same application. </li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Delete</span>: Remove the connection. Any flows that use this connection must be updated to use a different connection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To perform any of these actions, click the corresponding icon <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Workflows/connections-page.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> for the connection that you want to update.</p>
