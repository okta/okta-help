                <h1>Share and collaborate on flows</h1>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Topic Azuqua 2338/1801</p>
                <p>In the Home view, there are multiple folders to contain your flows. These are listed along the left pane of the window.</p>
                <p>There are two folders at the top of the list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">My Flows:</span> &#160;Flows stored in “My Flows” are private so only you can see and use them.</li>
                    <li><span class="uicontrol">Shared Flows:</span> &#160;Flows moved into “Shared Flows” are automatically shared with every user in your organization -- including new people who are invited later. Everyone can view, run, edit, view flow history, or delete any flow in this folder.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below the two built-in folders you’ll see a list other folders you’ve created or that have been shared with you. You can click “Create Folder” to add new ones.</p>
                <p>All folders that you create start out as private. When you select a custom folder, you’ll see a <span class="uicontrol">Sharing </span>button above the list of flows. Click it to decide who to share your folder with and how.</p>
                <p>A user may have one of our roles when using a custom folder:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">No Access</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Does not see the folder and cannot run or view the flows.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Run and View Only</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Can view and run all flows but cannot create or edit flows or view flow execution data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Run, View, History</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Similar to "Run and View Only" but can also view flow execution data. This is useful when you want to give a user permission to audit or debug flow results while still protecting the flow from unwanted edits.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Full Access</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Has full permission for the folder and all of its flows. Can create, edit, delete, view execution data, and change folder permissions.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>A user’s role determines their permissions for the flows currently contained in the folder as well as flows that are added later.</p>
                <h2>Sharing connnections to applications</h2>
                <p>Flows typically contain events or actions that connect to one or more applications that require connections. Just as flows can be shared, connections to applications can also be shared.</p>
                <p>There are three&#160;roles a user may have for a connection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Can Run</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Able to run or edit a flow that uses this connection, but only if it the flow&#160;been shared. Cannot access or modify the connection options or add new events or actions using this connection.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Can Use</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Able to add new events and actions using this connection.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span class="uicontrol">Can Edit</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>Has full permission for the connection. Can modify, change permissions for, or delete this connection.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>All new connections are <span class="uicontrol">Can Run</span> for all other users by default so that flows will just work&#160;when shared. If you don't want anyone to access the connection, don't share any flows that use the connection. If you want to restrict access, share only in&#160;folders where you are the only one&#160;set to <span class="uicontrol">Can Edit</span> for the folder.</p>
                <p>To allow others to use the connection for new actions and in new flows, add them as <span class="uicontrol">Can Use</span> and it will show up in their connection list, but they still won't be able to modify the connection. To share the connection with&#160;full permission, you can assign additional individuals to <span class="uicontrol">Can Edit</span>&#160;or,&#160;for shared company connections, you can set all users to have full permission.</p>
                <p>To change how a connection you created&#160;is shared, click on the gear icon that appears to the right of the connection name and choose <span class="uicontrol">Edit permissions</span>. You’ll find your connections for a specific application on the first tab of any event or action card that connects to that application. To find a full list of the connection you can edit or use, click the gear icon at the top-left of the Home screen and choose the Connections heading along the top.</p>
