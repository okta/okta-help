        <h1>End User Setup</h1>
        <p>After you have configured OMM, you must configure one or more Mobile Policies as described in Configuring Mobile Policies.</p>
        <p>After you've set up your security policies, your users can sign in to Okta Mobile to enroll. For end-user enrollment instructions, see <a href="https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=eu&amp;id=csh-user-om-omm-user" target="_blank">Okta Mobility Management - End User Setup</a> .</p>
        <h2>Help end users understand their privacy status</h2>
        <p>Beginning with Okta Mobile 5.0 for iOS and 2.16.0 for Android, an enhanced enrollment flow helps your end-users understand their device privacy status when their device(s) are enrolled in OMM. This makes it easier for end users to distinguish private data from data that is company-accessible.</p>
        <h2>End User Configuration</h2>
        <p>The following steps assume that you have enabled OMM and created one or more mobile policies. For details about creating policies for iOS or Android, see Configuring Mobile Policies.</p>
        <p>Once you have enabled policies for your end-users, they will immediately be prompted with the following enrollment flow when they sign into <span class="uicontrol">Okta Mobile</span>.</p>
        <p>End users have three options to proceed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Get Started</span> begins the end user enrollment of OMM.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Learn how we protect your privacy</span> provides a list of admin accessible data on the end-user’s device, once connected, as shown below.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Skip</span> allows users to come back later.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Mobile1.jpg" class="thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Mobile2.jpg" class="thumbnail" /> </p>
        <p>If the end user chooses to skip enrollment, they are immediately brought into their Okta <span class="uicontrol">App</span> page. Selecting <span class="uicontrol">Learn More</span> takes them back into the OMM starting page, allowing them another opportunity to enroll. This can also be accessed from the app <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> section of the app.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Privacy_LearnM.jpg" class="thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <p>Once enrolled, end-users can view their device status from the <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> screen. From here, they can also re-enroll if they have previously un-enrolled from OMM.</p>
