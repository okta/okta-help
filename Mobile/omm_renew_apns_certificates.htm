        <h1>Renew APNS Certificates</h1>
        <p>It's important that you renew Apple Push Notification (APNS) certificates in a timely manner; once an APNS certificate expires, you can't send commands to currently-enrolled devices, and new devices can't enroll. To reduce the likelihood of a certificate expiring, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exposes the certificate expiration date when you first create the certificate.</li>
            <li>Sends you an email notification 30 days, then 7 days, before expiration.</li>
            <li>Adds an error icon to the Apple Certificate Setup button on the Mobile Policy page when the certificate is within 30 days of expiration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> It's not possible to overwrite an existing certificate in Okta – don't worry about accidentally renewing the wrong certificate. However, you can avoid the hassle of reloading the same certificate by carefully following the instructions below.</p>
        <p>APNS certificates expire after one year. If you need to renew your certificate you need to first download a new <span class="uicontrol">Certificate Signing Request </span>(CSR) from Okta, as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/task steps/OMM_OMMPolicies.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Apple Certificate Setup</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/AppleCertificateSetupUpdated.png" class="thumbnail" />
                </p>
                <p>Note that a green check box on the <span class="uicontrol">Apple Certificate Setup</span> button indicates that a push certificate has already been configured, while a red exclamation point indicates the configured certificate has either expired or is close to expiring.</p>
                <p>The Apple Certificate Setup dialog appears:</p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="User-added image" src="../../Resources/Images/OMM_Renew_4_updated.png" class="thumbnail" />
                </p>
                <p>Note that step 2 on this screen displays information (highlighted in yellow, above) about your current APNS certificate, expired or not. Use this information to identify the certificate in the portal that you want to renew.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Download</span> to obtain your <span class="uicontrol">Certificate Signing Request</span> (okta-apns-CSR.dat) from Okta.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to the <span class="uicontrol">Apple Push Certificates Portal</span>, here: <a href="https://identity.apple.com/pushcert/" target="_blank">https://identity.apple.com/pushcert/</a> (your Apple ID is required to log into this portal).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Locate the certificate that has expired/is expiring, and click <span class="uicontrol">Renew</span>.</p>
                <p>You can click the information (<span class="uicontrol">i</span>) icon to view information about each certificate. Use this information to compare your certificates.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Choose File</span>, then navigate to the CSR file you previously downloaded for Apple to sign (okta-apns-CSR.dat), then click <span class="uicontrol">Upload</span>.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Once the request has been successfully uploaded a confirmation screen is displayed:</p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="User-added image" height="170" src="../../Resources/Images/OMM_Renew_6.png" class="thumbnail" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <span class="uicontrol">Download</span> on the confirmation screen.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Return to the <span class="uicontrol">Apple Certificate Setup</span> dialog box in Okta, in the <span class="uicontrol">Upload Apple Push Certificate</span> section, click <span class="uicontrol">Browse</span> to locate the renewed APNS that was just downloaded, then click <span class="uicontrol">Upload</span> to complete the process.</p>
            </li>
