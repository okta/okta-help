        If end users are running Okta Device Registration Task version 1.2.1 or lower and using the 32-bit version of Internet Explorer on their domain-joined computer, they may be prompted to pick the Device Trust certificate when accessing Device Trust-secured apps. This happens because pre-1.2.2 versions of the Device Registration Task automatically configure the 64-bit version of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge browsers. To prevent the certificate picker from displaying in this case, do either of the following:
        
            <ul><li><p>Upgrade to Okta Device Registration Task version 1.2.2+ as detailed in <a href="#B.2">section B.2</a>.</p></li><p>– or –</p><li><p>Edit the Windows registry as detailed in <a href="#TS-IE-64bit">Basic Troublshooting</a>.</p></li></ul></body>
