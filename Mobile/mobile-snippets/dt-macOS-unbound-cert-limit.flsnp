        <p> A certificate becomes bound to a given user the first time that user accesses a device trust-secured application from a device trust-secured macOS device. Unused certificates are unbound. Okta can issue up to five unbound certificates to the device, one each time you perform the enrollment procedure. As a security precaution, Okta will not issue more than five unbound certificates to a given device. To avoid reaching the unbound certificate limit, ensure that users use the unbound certificates already on the device before you attempt to obtain more certificates through enrollment. If you reach the enrollment limit, the Syslog indicates an enrollment failure and the error message <span class="uicontrol">Maximum enrollment limit of 5 certificates for a device is reached</span> appears in the JAMF log.</p>
