            <p>On January 1, 2020, Okta ended support for all Okta products on Android operating systems versions below 6.0. Accordingly, Okta recommends that you direct your end users to update their Android devices to a supported version (6.0 or higher).</p>

                <h4>Dates and Impacts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>October 9, 2019, no new releases:  After this date, Okta will no longer release new features to Android OS versions below 6.0.  We will continue to maintain existing features and provide bug fixes.</li>
                    <li>December 31, 2019, end of support date:  For all Okta products, after this date, admins will not be able to submit support cases for issues or bugs for problems occurring on Android OS versions below 6.0.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Okta products will continue to function on Android versions below 6.0, but end users will not be able to reinstall or upgrade Okta Mobile or Okta Verify until their device is on a supported version. After Okta support ends, Okta expects no immediate change to the existing end-user experience. New users on unsupported Android versions will not be able to view or download Okta apps from the app store until they upgrade to an Okta-supported version of Android.
