        <p>Make sure that certificates are installed in the keychain on the devices you have targeted for this Device Trust solution. If certificates are not installed and the Trusted setting is enabled in your app sign-on policy, users are denied access to the app and are redirected to a security message advising them to contact their administrator. (You can configure the message to include a <span class="uicontrol">Learn more</span> link to more information. See <a href="../Okta_Device_Trust_Jamf_macOS_Devices.htm#learn-more-link">Step 1 — Enable the global Device Trust setting for your org</a>). </p>
