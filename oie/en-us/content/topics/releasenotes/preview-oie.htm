This new experience enables independent software vendors (ISVs) to build and manually test their SCIM integration metadata before submission to the OIN. This reduces the time needed for the OIN team to review and validate that the SCIM integration functions as intended, which shortens the time to publish in the OIN. This experience also incorporates communication processes in Salesforce, enabling improved collaboration internally within Okta teams and externally with ISVs. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-app-overview/">Publish an OIN integration overview</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/scim/main/">Submit an integration with the OIN Wizard</a> guide.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user's email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.
