Admins can now offer their end users a free Okta Personal account to store personal data, allow them to switch between accounts, and migrate personal apps from Okta enterprise tenant to Okta Personal. When Okta Personal for Workforce is enabled, personalized comms will be sent to the end users encouraging them to use Okta Personal for personal data and Okta enterprise for work data.

                                                                                    <p>This feature creates an option in the password policy to match the same complexity options as Active Directory (AD). Until now, admins couldn't exactly match Okta password complexity requirements to those of their AD instances. Historically, the password complexity requirements in Okta and AD had different granularities, and the requirements displayed in the Sign-In Widget didn't always reflect the AD requirements. As a result, users were locked out without proper error messages. This feature bridges that gap.

By continuously analyzing risk signals that are native to Okta, risk signals from integrated security partner vendors, and your policy conditions, it safeguards orgs against identity attacks that occur during and outside of a user’s session. When Identity Threat Protection discovers a risk, it can immediately end the user’s sessions, prompt an MFA challenge, or invoke a workflow to restore your org’s security posture. Using intuitive dashboard widgets and reports, you can easily monitor security threats as they happen.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user's email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.
