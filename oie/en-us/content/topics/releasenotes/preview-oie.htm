You can add or remove users from groups based on their identity and access requirements. This ensures that changes made to user access in Okta are reflected in AD. When you use Okta Access Certifications to revoke a user's membership to an AD group, the removal is reflected in AD.

				Okta can only manage group memberships for users and groups imported into Okta using the AD integration. It isn't possible to manage users and groups that weren't imported through AD integration. It's also not possible to manage users and groups that are outside the organizational unit's scope for the integration using this feature.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user's email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.

                                                                        <p>Earlier versions of the self-service unlock (SSU) flow created unnecessary friction in the end user experience. The newly enhanced SSU feature introduces a seamless magic link experience in emails sent out to unlock accounts. Users no longer need to provide consent when using the same browser. In addition, after successfully unlocking their account, clicking the email magic link counts towards the application's assurance policy. After the assurance requirements are met, the user is signed directly in to the application.
