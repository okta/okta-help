		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.

			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production

Single or multiple agents can be updated on demand, or updates can be scheduled to occur outside of business hours to reduce downtime and disruption to users.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user’s email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.

While authentication policies allowed admins the ability to make application access decisions using user, device, and other contextual information, managing these policies across hundreds of applications became challenging and error-prone. 
					On the new <span class="uicontrol">Authentication Policies</span> page, admins can create new policies, apply those policies to multiple applications, and assess what application access decisions are impacted by each policy. 
					Two policy name changes are included in this release: <span class="uicontrol">app sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">authentication policy</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Okta sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">Global Session Policy</span>.
