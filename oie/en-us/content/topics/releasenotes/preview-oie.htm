With agent auto-update functionality, admins no longer need to manually uninstall and then reinstall Okta LDAP agents when a new agent version is released. Agent auto-updates keep your agents up to date and compliant with the Okta support policy, and help ensure your org has the latest Okta features and functionality. Single or multiple agents can be updated on demand, or updates can be scheduled to occur outside of business hours to reduce downtime and disruption to users.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user's email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.
