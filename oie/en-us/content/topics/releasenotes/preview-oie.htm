You can add or remove users from groups based on their identity and access requirements. This ensures that changes made to user access in Okta are reflected in AD. When you use Okta Access Certifications to revoke a user's membership to an AD group, the removal is reflected in AD.

				Okta can only manage group memberships for users and groups imported into Okta using the AD integration. It isn't possible to manage users and groups that weren't imported through AD integration. It's also not possible to manage users and groups that are outside the organizational unit's scope for the integration using this feature.

The new experience allows users to select a different authenticator if the PIV/CAC authentication fails, instead of forcing them to restart the sign-in process. 
				If your org uses default error pages for PIV/CAC sign-in, the new experience is automatically enabled for the org. If your org uses customized error pages for PIV/CAC sign-in, they are preserved. However, you need to contact Support to switch to the new experience.</p>

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user's email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.

					Two policy name changes are included in this release: <span class="uicontrol">app sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">authentication policy</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Okta sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">Global Session Policy</span>.
