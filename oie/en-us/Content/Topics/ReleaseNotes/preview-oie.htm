		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.

			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.

                                                                                <p>Earlier versions of the self-service registration (SSR) flow used a complicated array of templates to send activation emails to end users. The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user’s email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.

End users can quickly differentiate between SWA apps where they have set a username and password and SAML / OIDC apps that are admin-managed with no additional user settings. The updated app settings panel also provides accessibility improvements with better screen reader support and color contrast.

                                                                            <p>Previously, the self-service unlock (SSU) and self-service password reset (SSPR) flows created unnecessary friction for AD and LDAP users. This enhancement introduces a seamless magic link in emails sent to unlock accounts and reset passwords. Users no longer need to provide consent when using the same browser. In addition, after successfully unlocking their account, clicking the email magic link counts towards the application's assurance policy. After the assurance requirements are met, the user is signed in directly to the application.

It becomes even more challenging when the users try to perform sensitive transactions.

The device in which the transaction is initiated by the OIDC application is called the consumption device and the device where the user verifies the transaction is called the authentication device.

While authentication policies allowed admins the ability to make application access decisions using user, device, and other contextual information, managing these policies across hundreds of applications became challenging and error-prone. 
					On the new <span class="uicontrol">Authentication Policies</span> page, admins can create new policies, apply those policies to multiple applications, and assess what application access decisions are impacted by each policy. 
					Two policy name changes are included in this release: <span class="uicontrol">app sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">authentication policy</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Okta sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">Global Session Policy</span>.
