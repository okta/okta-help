		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.

			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.

Now, we have the Devices SDK, which lets you embed push notifications and biometric verification inside your organization’s mobile apps. Your users are presented with a push and biometric experience within your organization’s apps, with your organization’s branding on it. They never have to leave your app, and they don’t need to download a third-party app, such as Okta Verify, to complete their verification.

                                                                                <p>Okta inline hook calls to third-party external web services previously provided only header-based authentication for security. Although sent with SSL, the header or custom header authentication didn’t meet more stringent security requirements for various clients and industries.</p>
                                                                                <p> 

				To improve the security of inline hooks, Okta now supports authentication with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Tokens ensure secure calls to external web services.

				</p>
                                                                                <p>When creating inline hooks in the Admin Console (or by API), administrators or developers can now select OAuth 2.0 authentication and choose between two methods of OAuth 2.0: Client Secret or Private Key. A new <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/hook-keys" target="_blank">Key Management API</a> and Admin Console page is also available to create public/private key pairs for use with OAuth 2.0 inline hooks. See <a href="../automation-hooks/manage-keys.htm" class="MCXref xref">Manage keys</a>.</p>
                                                                                <p>
			Using the OAuth 2.0 framework provides better security than Basic Authentication, and is less work than setting up an IP allowlisting solution. Clients also have the ability to use access tokens minted by their own custom authorization servers to guarantee that Okta is calling their client web services and it isn't triggered by any external actors.

It becomes even more challenging when the users try to perform sensitive transactions. Okta uses Client-initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) to provide customers with a simple and secure transaction verification solution.</p>
                                                                                <p>CIBA extends OIDC to define a decoupled flow where the authentication or transaction flow is initiated on one device and verified on another. The device in which the transaction is initiated by the OIDC application is called the consumption device and the device where the user verifies the transaction is called the authentication device.

Currently, it isn't clear which OAuth 2.0 authenticated app consumes all the rate limits for an org. This increases the risk that one app consumes the entire rate limit bucket. To avoid this possibility, Okta admins can now configure how much rate limit capacity an individual OAuth 2.0 app can consume by editing the Application rate limits tab for each app. By setting a capacity on individual OAuth 2.0 apps, Okta admins have a new tool to monitor and investigate rate limit violations, and have the ability to view rate limit traffic generated by individual OAuth 2.0 apps.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user’s email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.
