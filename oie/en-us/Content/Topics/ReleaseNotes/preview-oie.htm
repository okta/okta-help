		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

This feature offers a granular control over iFrame embedding compared to the existing embedding option in Customization, which doesn't let you distinguish between secure and non-secure origins. Trusted Origins under <span class="uicontrol">Security</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">API</span> allows you to selectively configure the origins you trust. It also provides enhanced security as it uses a more secure <span class="code">frame-ancestors</span> directive in Content Security Policy that protects your data from web attacks such as clickjacking. You can also migrate your existing iFrames to Trusted Origins. See <a href="../API/trusted-origins-iframe.htm" class="MCXref xref">Trusted Origins for iFrame embedding</a>.</p>

When this is configured, Okta only accepts SAML requests signed using the certificate associated with the app integration. Having signed SAML requests also resolves scenarios where the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL requested after authentication can be one of several domains or URLs. When a Service Provider sends a signed authentication request, Okta can accept dynamic ACS values as part of the SAML request and posts the SAML assertion response to the ACS value specified in the request.
