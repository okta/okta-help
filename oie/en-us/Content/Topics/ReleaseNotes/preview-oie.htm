			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

The simplified SSR flow reduces this to only two email templates with customized welcome messages. If your application requires immediate verification of the end user’s email address, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Activation</span> template. This template includes a magic link for a smoother sign-in experience. If email verification isn't immediately required to sign in to the application, Okta uses the <span class="uicontrol">Registration - Email Verification</span> template. This template includes a link for end users to complete email verification at any time after they successfully sign in to the application.
