		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

The newly enhanced SSU feature introduces a seamless magic link experience in emails sent out to unlock accounts. Users no longer need to provide consent when using the same browser. In addition, after successfully unlocking their account, clicking the email magic link counts towards the application's assurance policy. After the assurance requirements are met, the user is signed directly in to the application.

                                                                            <p>Okta provides the Okta Sign-In Widget out of the box so that customers can authenticate users by simply redirecting them to the widget. For customers who need a customized sign-in experience, Okta also provides a widget SDK that developers can embed within their applications. This embedded widget uses a custom authorization mode called the Interaction Code grant type to authenticate users. The Embedded widget sign-in support toggle allows super admins to disable the embedded sign-in option across all applications and authorization servers. This helps to create consistency and improves the security posture of your applications.

                                                                            <p>Okta inline hook calls to third-party external web services previously provided only header-based authentication for security. Although sent with SSL, the header or custom header authentication didn’t meet more stringent security requirements for various clients and industries.</p>
                                                                            <p> 

				To improve the security of inline hooks, Okta now supports authentication with OAuth 2.0 access tokens. Tokens ensure secure calls to external web services.

				</p>
                                                                            <p>When creating inline hooks in the Admin Console (or by API), administrators or developers can now select OAuth 2.0 authentication and choose between two methods of OAuth 2.0: Client Secret or Private Key. A new <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/hook-keys" target="_blank">Key Management API</a> and Admin Console page is also available to create public/private key pairs for use with OAuth 2.0 inline hooks. See <a href="../automation-hooks/manage-keys.htm" class="MCXref xref">Manage keys</a>.</p>
                                                                            <p>
			Using the OAuth 2.0 framework provides better security than Basic Authentication, and is less work than setting up an IP allowlisting solution. Clients also have the ability to use access tokens minted by their own custom authorization servers to guarantee that Okta is calling their client web services and it isn't triggered by any external actors.
