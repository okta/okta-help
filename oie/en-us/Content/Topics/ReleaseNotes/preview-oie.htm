		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

After a successful password reset where the password meets the application’s assurance policy, the user is signed directly to the app. See <a href="../identity-engine/authenticators/configure-email-authenticator.htm" class="MCXref xref">Configure the Email authenticator</a>.</p>

However, if a customer deletes the default authorization server, it can't be restored, causing confusion and disruption. This enhancement prevents you from deleting the default authorization server, although you can disable it if isn’t required. To aid in identification, Okta adds a <span class="uicontrol">Default</span> label for the default authorization server in the Admin Console.

                                                                                <p>Org admins can now consolidate multiple IdP routing rules into a single dynamic routing rule. Dynamic routing rules use expression language to match users to any IdP, based on attributes of their login object. This reduces the volume and complexity of routing rules and the manual effort of managing them.

Okta now offers the ability to clone a policy. You can use either the Admin Console or the new Clone a Policy operation on the Policy API.

This enables admins to configure their policies with more granularity, bringing even greater security and flexibility. This release brings this feature into parity with the functionality available in Classic Engine.

While authentication policies allowed admins the ability to make application access decisions using user, device, and other contextual information, managing these policies across hundreds of applications became challenging and error-prone. 
					On the new <span class="uicontrol">Authentication Policies</span> page, admins can create new policies, apply those policies to multiple applications, and assess what application access decisions are impacted by each policy. 
					Two policy name changes are included in this release: <span class="uicontrol">app sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">authentication policy</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Okta sign-on policy</span> is renamed <span class="uicontrol">Global Session Policy</span>.
