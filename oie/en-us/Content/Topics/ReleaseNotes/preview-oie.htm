		(1) Weekly Release Enhancements:
			- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-enh" condition.
			- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
			- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will stay in Preview:
		 	- These items should show up on two pages - this month's Monthly Preview, and in the "preview-only-features" snippet after this month is over.
			- Apply "preview-only" condition on them.
			
		(3) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
			- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.
			- Apply "n-only" condition on them.
			
		(4) Preview items from previous releases that will be released to Production 
			- Cut and paste these items from "preview-only-features.flsnp" to this file.
			- Apply "production-only" condition on them.

                                                                                <p>Email magic links have been enhanced to allow end users to authenticate in two different contexts. They can authenticate in the same location where they click the link and quickly return to the application context. Or, if the end user clicks the link in a different browser, they can enter a one-time password to proceed with authentication. Previously when using email magic links to sign in to an application, end users had to return to the original browser location where they initiated the sign-in attempt. Okta ensures that end users can prove ownership of both the originating tab and the tab where they clicked the email magic link. See <a href="../identity-engine/authenticators/configure-email-authenticator.htm" class="MCXref xref">Configure the Email authenticator</a> and <a href="https://help.okta.com/eu/en-us/Content/Topics/end-user/eu-sign-in-to-apps.htm">Sign in to resources protected by Okta</a>.</p>

                                                                                <p>Passwords are weak authenticators and prone to security issues. Currently all users are required to enroll a password. This also causes friction during the self-service registration process. You can now create a password-optional or passwordless sign-in experience for your end users. It makes the registration process quicker by removing the need to set up a password. It also provides a safer and more secure sign-in experience as users can instead use stronger authenticators such as possession-based authenticators or biometrics. Okta gives you the flexibility to target specific groups of users in your organization with passwordless flows, allowing you to gradually roll out the experience across your entire user base.

In addition to Okta groups, admins now have the option to view the application groups that are significant to their orgs, including Active Directory (AD) and LDAP groups.

Admins can limit search results to specific criteria using the SCIM protocol to query. They can also use Created On and Last Updated On in their queries to identify when users or groups were created or last modified, and search for groups and users using both base and custom attributes. These advanced search options optimize search results and help reduce the time spent searching for specific information.

		- These are shared from the respective snippets from the last month using the "n+1-bug" condition.
		- They should show up on two pages - last month's Weekly Update Preview, after that this month's Monthly Production.
		- These Weekly Update snippets are already mapped and conditioned in this snippet, so there's nothing you need to do as long as these items are conditioned "n+1-enh" in their respective Weekly Update snippet.
			
		(2) Items that will be released to Preview and Production in the same release.
		- These items should show up in this month's Monthly Preview and Production.

The addition of the Progressive Enrollment feature helps you to capture the minimum user information required to create a profile and then expand and enhance those user profiles during subsequent sign-in operations. Admins can control what information is collected, validate those input values, and trigger inline hooks during the self-service registration and progressive enrollment flows.
