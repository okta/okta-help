        <h1>Detect Jailbroken and Rooted devices</h1>
        <p>Jailbroken (iOS) or rooted (Android) devices are identified on the <span class="uicontrol">Okta Mobility Management</span> page with an icon and label:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/JailbreakRoot.jpg" class="thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Jailbroken</span>: Indicates that a user has installed unsupported software on an iOS device. This may have been done to run custom software without Apple's permission, or to pirate copies of software or in-app purchases.</li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Rooted</span>: Indicates that a user has access to alter the firmware or OS that Google and the manufacturer or carrier shipped with the device. This does not necessarily mean that the user has done anything inappropriate with their device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Jailbroken and rooted devices are more vulnerable to malware. You may want to deprovision these devices or assess the associated risks. </p>
