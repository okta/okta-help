        <h1>Okta Mobility Management with Android for Work</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Mobile/mobile-snippets/OMM-new-sales-not-supported.flsnp" />
        <p>Android for Work, or Android in the enterprise, is Google's solution to enterprise mobility management. Enrolling a user in Okta Mobility Management (OMM) through Android for Work creates an encrypted, containerized Work profile on their device, and installs a managed Google Play store. These allow you to assign separate managed versions of work apps, like Box or Outlook, as well as selectively wipe company data from an end user's device, while leaving their personal data intact. </p>
        <h2>Supported Versions of Android</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Android 5.1.1 (L) and later</li>
            <li>
                <p>If you enable Android for Work, we strongly recommend you deploy Google Chrome to your OMM users in order to prevent unexpected behavior on certain older Android devices. See <a href="../Mobile/access-managed-mobile-apps.htm">Enable access to managed mobile apps</a> for information on deploying managed apps.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When a work profile is configured on an Android O device, Google Chrome is automatically installed. This prevents Okta Mobile and other apps that use web views from crashing due to a bug in Android O. See the <a href="https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/7506908">Google documentation of the bug</a> for details.</p>
            </li>

        <h2>Set up Android for Work</h2>
        <p>See <a href="http://saml-doc.okta.com/How_Tos/Android_For_Work.html">Setting up Android for Work in Okta</a> for instructions.</p>
        <h2><a name="Configure_a_Work_profile_passcode_policy"></a>Configure a Work profile passcode policy</h2>
        <p>OMM allows you to configure passcode policies for any supported Android device. These policies allow you to require your users to enter a passcode that meets your specifications to unlock their device. They are applied based on groups you create, which allows you to set different levels of access and security for different people.</p>
        <p>For an additional level of flexibility, you can also set a separate work profile passcode policy for your users with Android 7.0+ devices. You can use this policy to require users to enter a passcode before accessing apps managed by their work profile, which allows you to set a more secure policy for accessing work resources than for accessing personal apps and data. This way, your users can easily access their personal resources without having to enter complex passwords, while still keeping company data safe and secure.</p>
        <p>Note: Requires Okta Mobile 3.0 or above.</p>
        <p>To set a work profile passcode policy, you must create or edit a device policy, then configure that policy's Android rule.</p>
        <h3>Create a device policy</h3>

The agreement appears on end users devices and end users must acknowledge it before they can proceed to OMM enrollment. As part of the OMM enrollment process, end users are warned that enrolling in OMM gives admins certain controls over their devices. This User Agreement is an opportunity to provide additional custom terms and conditions you may want your end users to acknowledge.</p></li></ul></li>

            </p>
            <p>Important: If you configured a work passcode for your users with Android 7.0+&#160;devices, the general device passcode policy that you may have <a href="#ReqDevicePasscode-General">configured above</a> in General Requirements no longer applies to them. If you want to require these users to lock their device as well as their work profile, select <span class="uicontrol">Require a device passcode</span> here, and then specify the passcode requirements.</p>
            <p><span class="uicontrol">PIN minimum length</span> — Minimum number of required characters (from 4 to 30).</p>
            <p><span class="uicontrol">Characters</span> — You can specify whether passcodes must contain at least one letter, and/or at least one symbol.</p>
            <p><span class="uicontrol">Expiration</span> — Either passcodes never expire (the default), or you can specify the number of days after which they expire (<span class="uicontrol">Max age</span>), and the number of distinct passwords a user must create before they can reuse a previous password (<span class="uicontrol">History limit</span>; prevents users from reusing a previous password for a specified period of time ). </p>
            <p><span class="uicontrol">Failed attempts before wipe</span> — Specify the maximum number of times end users can enter the wrong passcode before their device is wiped. Note the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="font-weight: normal;">Select <span class="uicontrol">Unlimited attempts</span> if you never want to wipe a device because of failed passcode attempts.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>On Android for Work, only the Work profile is wiped.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Devices are not wiped if users enter the wrong passcode less than 4 times.</li>
                <li>You can allow up to 10 attempts before a wipe occurs. </li>
            </ul>

        </ol>
        <h2>Known issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If they use Okta Mobile 4.21.0 on Android 11 or 12, and a passcode isn’t set up on the device, users might not be able to access Play for Work even if you change the OMM policy to allow access without a device passcode. Users receive the following message: “Play for Work is not available. Play for Work is still being enabled, please try again later.” To access Play for Work, users must set up the work profile again.</li>
            <li>

If users enroll in Android for Work using Okta Mobile 4.21.0 on Android 11 or 12, apps configured for the work profile are not installed automatically. However, users can download the apps from the Play for Work app store.

</li>
            <li>Although you configure an OMM policy to require both work and device passcode, users who enroll in the work profile with Okta Mobile 4.21.0 on Android 11 or 12 are prompted to set only the work profile password. The setup wizard doesn’t prompt users to set the device password. After setting up the work profile password, users can access their work apps.</li>
            <li>Applies to Android devices running versions 7.1 or 7.1.1; fixed in 7.1.2: After an admin strengthens a group's work profile passcode policy, end users are prompted to update their passcode to comply with the updated policy. However, when end users respond to the prompt, their device passcode is updated instead of their work profile passcode. If the end user's Security settings allow different device and work profile passcodes, they are prompted continually to update their work profile passcode until they change it in their device settings.</li>
            <li>On November 1, 2020 Google ended support for Native Android and Samsung SAFE enrollment types. Okta will no longer support Native Android and Samsung SAFE enrollment types in OMM&#160;policy rules on devices running Android 10 or later. Native Android and Samsung SAFE enrollment options will continue to work for Android 9 and earlier devices. Do the following:<ul><li>If you configure new OMM&#160;policy rules, make sure to select the Android for Work enrollment type so that users on Android 10+ devices can enroll and remain compliant. </li><li>Check your existing OMM&#160;policy rules and update any that are currently configured with the Native Android and/or Samsung SAFE options to make sure that they also include the Android for Work option so that users on Android 10+ devices can enroll and remain compliant. </li><li>To force Android 10+ users to re-enroll to the Android for Work enrollment option, go to the Okta OMM devices dashboard (<span class="uicontrol">OMM</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="uicontrol">Okta Mobility Management</span>) and un-enroll any Android 10+ device users that may be enrolled with the Native Android or Samsung SAFE enrollment options.</li></ul><p class="noteContent">See the <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/announcement-center?language=en_US&amp;_ga=2.240101955.1522821803.1603056664-209292993.1579624839&amp;_gac=1.262657534.1599686022.Cj0KCQjw-uH6BRDQARIsAI3I-UdvyCH6E7XuObWw1dXQkgFnUAA1HH0kuC_r-gWYR8rnKdLOwO24M7EaAkvtEALw_wcB" target="_blank">Announcement Log.</a></p></li>
