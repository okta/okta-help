      <h1>Wipe data from a device</h1>
      <p>When you select a wipe option:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Online devices are wiped and unenrolled from OMM when they come online (cellular or WiFi).</li>
         <li>Offline devices are not wiped until they come online. Until the devices are online, users can access corporate data on the device, and admins may see the device <span class="uicontrol">Status</span> as <span class="uicontrol">Enrolled</span>, on the Okta Admin Console <span class="uicontrol">OMM</span> page.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Devices</span> page has two data wipe options: </p>
      <ul>
         <li>

      </ul>
      <h2>
         <a name="Wipe_company_data"/>Wipe only company data from a device</h2>
      <p>When you wipe company data from a device, managed apps and configurations are removed from the device, and the device is unenrolled from OMM. Wiped devices are listed as <span class="uicontrol">Deprovisioned</span> in the <span class="uicontrol">Status</span> column of the upper dashboard and in the downloadable CSV report. When a user is deactivated from Okta, their OMM-enrolled device is automatically deprovisioned and all company-managed apps and data are removed from the device in OMM. If the user is reactivated later, they must re-enroll their device. Wiping company data does not require end-user confirmation. After you wipe a device of company data, users see the effects of the wipe the next time they sign in.</p>
      <p>Complete this procedure before you unenroll a user from OMM. Discourage users from removing or unenrolling from OMM themselves; otherwise, the Okta servers may never detect the removal (for example, if there is a poor network connection or if the device is offline). This creates a scenario in which a deprovisioned device is still shown as <span class="uicontrol">Enrolled</span> on the <span class="uicontrol">OMM</span> page. This scenario can occur regardless of a device's rooted or jailbroken status.</p>

         <p>Okta-managed native apps are wiped. Personal apps, content, and settings are not wiped. (You can also do this from the <span class="uicontrol">Device Attributes</span> page using the <span class="uicontrol">Device Actions</span> drop-down menu.)</p>

      <p>When you wipe all data from a device, all apps and data are removed from the device, and the device is returned to its factory settings. Like the <span class="uicontrol">Wipe Company Data</span> option, this option also unenrolls the device from OMM. Once wiped, these devices are listed as <span class="uicontrol">Deprovisioned</span> under the <span class="uicontrol">Status</span> column and the device appears in the device report as <span class="uicontrol">Deprovisioned</span>. If the user is reactivated later, they must re-enroll their device.</p>
