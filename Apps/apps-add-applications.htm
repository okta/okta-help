        <h1>Add existing app integrations</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations">Okta Integration Network</a> (OIN) contains thousands of prepared app integrations. As an admin, you can add these integrations to your org and assign them to your end users. After end users sign in to their Okta End-User Dashboard, these app integrations appear on their dashboard, giving them one-click access to the applications they need.
        </p>
        <p>This topic covers adding and setting up app integrations that exist in the OIN. They only require the administrator to add the integration and configure it to work with their particular Okta instance and configuration.</p>
        <h2>About admin roles for this task</h2>
        <p>The administrator running this task must be a super admin for the Okta org.
        </p>
        <p>After the app integration is added to the Okta org, app admins can configure and assign the app integration to the appropriate users and groups.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin
        </h2>
        <p>The admin must be signed in to the Okta Admin Console.</p>
        <h2>Add an app integration</h2>
        <p>To add an existing app integration to your org:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/task steps/Applications_Applications.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Browse App Catalog</span>.</li>
            <li>To search for the app integration, perform one of these two options:
                <ul><li>Type the name of the specific app integration into the <span class="uicontrol">Search...</span> bar. You can click the name in the dropdown list or click <span class="uicontrol">See All Results</span> to have everything displayed as tiles in the main panel. Click the tile to open the details page for the app integration.</li><li>Choose a <span class="uicontrol">Use Case</span> and optionally select one or more functionalities to filter the results. When you see the desired app integration in the main panel, click it to open the details page for more information about the integration.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Determine if this is the correct app integration for your needs. The <span class="wintitle">Overview</span> tab on the details page shows a detailed description of the app integration and, if available, the Okta verification status:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Okta Verified</span>: This integration was created by Okta or by Okta community users, then tested and verified by Okta.</li>
                <li><span class="uicontrol">Community Created</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Unverified</span>: This integration was created by the community and has shown some evidence of quality, such as active usage or multiple community members using it. However, Okta hasn't tested this app integration, and it isn't officially supported.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Click the <span class="wintitle">Capabilities</span> tab on the details page to see the supported <span class="uicontrol">Access</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Provisioning</span> features of the app integration.
            </li>
            <li>Optional. If you can't find the desired app integration in the OIN App Catalog, click <span class="uicontrol">Back to Add Application</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">Create New App</span>. This launches the App Integration Wizard (AIW), which allows administrators to create custom app integrations for their org. See <MadCap:xref href="Apps_App_Integration_Wizard.htm">App Integration Wizard</MadCap:xref>.
            </li>
            <li>When you find the app integration you want, click <span class="uicontrol">Add</span> on the details page.</li>
            <li>Enter the required information under <span class="wintitle">General Settings</span>, and then click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="wintitle">Sign On Options</span> page, select one of the <span class="uicontrol">Sign on methods</span>. The sign-in options available depend on the access protocols supported by the app integration. See <MadCap:xref href="Apps_Overview_of_Managing_Apps_and_SSO.htm">Single Sign-On in applications</MadCap:xref>.<div class="noteOkta"><p class="noteContent">For SWA app integrations, you can't configure the sign-in options when <span class="uicontrol">Sync Password</span> is configured as a provisioning option.</p></div></li>
            <li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Application username format</span> dropdown list, select a format for Okta to use as the default username value when assigning the app integration to users. If you select <span class="uicontrol">None</span> and the app integration has password or profile push provisioning features, then Okta prompts you to enter the username manually when you assign the app integration.</li>
            <li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Update application username on</span> dropdown list, select how you want the app integration to handle any updates to the user's Okta username:
                <ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Create Only</span>: The Okta username is exchanged with the external application  when the admin first assigns the app integration to the user. Any future updates to the Okta username aren't applied to the external account.</li></ul><ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Create and Update</span>: The Okta username is exchanged with the external application when the admin first assigns the app integration to the user. If their profile is updated later, Okta updates the username with the external application. See <MadCap:xref href="../users-groups-profiles/usgp-auto-update-app-username.htm">Automatically update an app username</MadCap:xref>.</li></ul></li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">Password reveal</span>: For SWA app integrations, you can allow end users to see the password used to connect to the external application. This feature is helpful if end users need to enter a long, complicated, and randomly generated password into another device. See <MadCap:xref href="Apps_Revealing_the_Password.htm">Reveal the password of an app</MadCap:xref>.
</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Done</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Okta adds an instance of the app integration to your org, and you can now assign it to your end users. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-assign-applications.htm">Assign app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>If you need to update the settings for your app integration, including  changing sign-in options, see <MadCap:xref href="apps-configure-settings.htm"> Configure settings for app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</p>
