        <h1>Add app integrations as an end user</h1>
        <p>The Okta End-User Dashboard is an interface that offers end users secure access to the enterprise applications and information in an Okta org. With the Self Service feature, end users can add app integrations to their dashboard.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin
        </h2>
        <p>The administrator must activate the Self Service feature and permit end users to request app integrations. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-configureorg.htm">Enable Self Service request feature</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>For any app integrations that require review and approval before being assigned to end users, the admin must configure the approval request workflow. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-configureapprovalflow.htm">Configure the app integration approval workflow</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>The end user needs to sign in to their dashboard.</p>
        <h2>Start this procedure<br /></h2>
        <p>There are three activities that an end user can perform from the dashboard. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If an app integration exists in the Okta catalog and the SSO&#160;or provisioning functionality has been configured by an admin, then end users can add it directly to their dashboard. These app integrations may require additional approval for end users to be granted access.
                <p>See <MadCap:xref href="#add-org-integrations">Add an org-managed app integration</MadCap:xref>.</p></li>
            <li>If the app integration exists in the catalog but the administrators have not configured it for the org, end users can add it to their dashboard. However, this applies to app integrations where a username and password are the only credentials required to access the external application.
				<p>
					See <MadCap:xref href="#add-personal-integrations">Add a personal app integration</MadCap:xref>.
				</p></li>
            <li>Finally, end users can make a direct request to the org admins to have an external application added as a configured app integration to the org.
				<p>
					See <MadCap:xref href="#request-integrations">Request an app integration</MadCap:xref>.
				</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="add-org-integrations"></a>Add an org-managed app integration</h3>
        <p>This task is only available if the admin has enabled the <span class="uicontrol">Allow users to add org-managed apps</span> option in the Self Service feature. </p>
        <p>End users can choose to add app integrations that admins have already configured for Single Sign-On (SSO) or provisioning functionality. These app integrations appear inside the app catalog in a filtered category.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the End-User Dashboard, click <span class="uicontrol">Add apps</span>.</li>
            <li>The default filter is labeled <span class="uicontrol">Apps managed by {org}</span>, where {org} is the name of your Okta org. <br />From this filtered list of app integrations, choose one of the following options:<ul><li>If the app integration is already approved for use by anyone in the org, click <span class="uicontrol">Add</span> to add it directly to the End-User Dashboard. No further action is required.</li><li>If the app integration request has to be approved by an admin or business unit delegate before it can be assigned, click <span class="uicontrol">Request</span> to initiate the workflow. A dialog appears where you can enter any comments for the approvers. Click <span class="uicontrol">Request app</span> to submit the request.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the app integration requires approval, the request is forwarded to the approval chain. During the approval process, end users receive updates through dashboard notifications or email, depending on how the admins configure the notification options. After the request is approved by everyone in the workflow, Okta automatically adds the requested app integration directly to the End-User Dashboard.</p>
        <h3><a name="add-personal-integrations"></a>Add a personal app integration</h3>
        <p>This task is only available if the org admin has enabled the <span class="uicontrol">Allow users to add personal apps</span> option in the Self Service feature. </p>
        <p>Org admins do not configure SSO and provisioning for every app integration in the Okta app catalog. They also may not have added the configured app integrations to the approved list of Self Service app integrations. However, end users can still use the Okta app catalog to add any app integration that only requires a username and password for account creation. Only that end user sees the personal version as an app integration tile on their dashboard. If the app integration isn't in the catalog, the end user can add to their dashboard a new bookmark to act as a link to any external application. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the End-User Dashboard, click <span class="uicontrol">Add apps</span>.</li>
            <li>If the administrators have enabled the option to allow personal app integrations in the org, the <span class="uicontrol">Filter</span> shows all the available categories in the app catalog. End users can choose a specific category filter to narrow the selections or choose <span class="uicontrol">All Apps</span> to search the entire catalog. In the search bar, enter the name of the app integration.</li>
            <li>If the app integration is in the catalog, click <span class="uicontrol">Add</span> to add the app integration to the dashboard. This integration can only pass a stored username and password to sign in to the external application. The admins haven't configured this app integration, so the first time it runs, a <span class="wintitle">Sign In To App</span> dialog requests the username and password credentials for the external application.</li>
            <li>If the app integration isn't in the catalog, click <span class="uicontrol">Add a bookmark instead</span> to add a bookmark on the dashboard.
                <p>Enter the URL and a name for the external application. </p><p>If the org admin has enabled the <span class="uicontrol">Allow users to email "Technical Contact" to request an app</span> option of the Self Service feature, you can also select <span class="uicontrol">Ask {org} IT to add this app</span> to submit a request to have the external application added.</p><p>When the you click this bookmark app on your dashboard, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> launches the destination URL but does not pass credentials to the external application.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="request-integrations"></a>Request an app integration</h3>
        <p>This task is only available if the admin has enabled the <span class="uicontrol">Allow users to email "Technical Contact"&#160;to request an app</span> option in the Self Service feature. </p>
        <p>To request that org admins add an Okta app integration for an external application:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Request an app</span> link at the bottom of the End-User Dashboard. </li>
            <li>In the dialog that appears, enter a message to the org admin with information about the external application.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Send to {org name} IT</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A message about the external application is sent to org admin for review. If approved, the admins can set up the connection with the external application and then assign that app integration to the appropriate end users.</p>
