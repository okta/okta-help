        <p>You can configure settings for your app integration using the  tabs on the app integration  page. </p>
        <h2>About admin roles for this task</h2>
        <p>The administrator running this task must have at least one of the following roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Super admin for the Okta org</li>
            <li>App admin for the Okta org</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Read-only admins can see the settings for individual app integrations, but can't make any changes.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin
        </h2>
        <p>The admin must sign in to the Admin Console.</p>
        <h2>Start this task<br /></h2>
        <p>To access the settings page:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/task steps/Applications_Applications.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>In the main panel, click the app integration you want to update. You can also enter the name in the <span class="uicontrol">Search</span> bar.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Okta displays the settings page for the app integration, organized into several tabs. The tabs displayed depend on the type of app integration and which features are enabled for your org.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>This tab shows the general app integration settings, which vary by app integration. These settings may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="wintitle">App Settings</span>: Configure application-specific settings such as the application label and visibility. Some of these settings include:<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Application label</span>:&#160;This is the label that's displayed for the application on the End-User Dashboard. </li><li><span class="uicontrol">Application visibility</span>: Select <span class="uicontrol">Do not display application icon to users</span> to hide the app from users. Select <span class="uicontrol">Do not display application icon in the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.Okta Mobile" /> app</span> to prevent the app from being used from <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.Okta Mobile" />.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">URL</span>: The URL of the login page for a Bookmark App. Other types of apps may also include a similar field for an application-specific URL.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Request Integration</span>: For an app integration that you created, select this to request that <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> review the app to add it to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Integration Network (OIN). This property only applies to Bookmark App integrations.  See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-app/openidconnect/overview/" target="_blank">Submit an app integration</a> for more information on adding an app integration to the OIN.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Browser plugin auto-submit</span>: Select <span class="uicontrol">Automatically log in when user lands on login page</span> to automatically sign in users when they access an app login page.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Auto-launch</span>: Applying this option only affects newly assigned users. Users who were already assigned to the app integration need to open the tile settings in their dashboard and select <span class="uicontrol">Auto-launch the app when user signs into Okta</span>. When auto-launch is enabled here or by end users, signing in to Okta may cause more than one instance of the app to appear as an additional tab or window. This behavior is expected, and the user may safely close any unwanted tabs or windows.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Application notes for end users</span>: A note about the app that end users can view on their dashboard.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Application notes for admins</span>: A note about the app that admins can view on the <span class="uicontrol">General</span> tab of the application's settings page.</li></ul></li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">VPN Notification</span>: This feature alerts end users when a VPN connection is required to connect to the app integration. When end users click the app integration tile, Okta displays a notification before launching the app. You can customize this notification to remind users about VPN requirements. See <MadCap:xref href="Apps_VPN_Notification.htm">VPN Notifications</MadCap:xref>.<div class="noteOkta"><p class="noteContent">The VPN notification doesn't appear if the end user has enabled the <span class="uicontrol">Auto-launch</span> option in the <span class="uicontrol">General</span> settings of the app integration tile.</p></div></li>
            <li><span class="uicontrol">App Embed Link</span>: Use this section to copy an embed link for the app integration, redirect users to a custom login page, or redirect users to a custom error page.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Sign On</h3>
        <p>After adding the app integration, you can return to the <span class="wintitle">Sign On</span> tab to configure or change any of your sign-in settings. The available options vary by app integration. See <MadCap:xref href="Apps_Overview_of_Managing_Apps_and_SSO.htm">Single Sign-On in applications</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.Classic">You can configure your <span class="uicontrol">Sign on methods</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Credentials Details</span> for the app integration. You can also configure the app's <span class="uicontrol">Sign On Policy</span>. See <MadCap:xref href="../Security/policies/about-app-signon-policies.htm">About app sign-on policies</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.OIE">You can configure your <span class="uicontrol">Sign on methods</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Credentials Details</span> for the app integration. You can also configure the app's <span class="uicontrol">Sign On Policy</span>. See <MadCap:xref href="../identity-engine/policies/about-app-sign-on-policies.htm">App sign-on policies</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Mobile</h3>
        <p MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.Classic">This tab is only available for app integrations with which native apps have been tested to work under Okta Mobility Management policies. See <MadCap:xref href="../Mobile/access-managed-mobile-apps.htm">Enable access to managed mobile apps</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.OIE">This tab is only available for app integrations with which native apps have been tested to work under Okta Mobility Management policies.</p>
        <h3>Provisioning</h3>
        <p>If provisioning is enabled for the app integration, this tab allows you to automate the creation, updates, and deactivation activities for user accounts to and from the external application. See <MadCap:xref href="Provisioning_Deprovisioning_Overview.htm">Provisioning</MadCap:xref>.
		</p>
        <h3>Import</h3>
        <p>You can assign the app to users you import, either from an available list of users or from a CSV file. See <MadCap:xref href="../users-groups-profiles/usgp-import-users-main.htm">Import users</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Assignments</h3>
        <p>Use the <span class="uicontrol">Assign</span> button to assign people and groups to the new app. Use the left-side <span class="uicontrol">Filters</span> panel to switch between <span class="uicontrol">People</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Groups</span> views. </p>
        <p>To assign a specific app integration to individual users or groups:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Assign</span>.</li>
            <li>Choose either <span class="uicontrol">Assign to People</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Assign to Groups</span>. An <span class="uicontrol">Assign &lt;app name&gt; to People</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Assign &lt;app name&gt; to Groups</span> dialog lists the available end users or groups who aren't already assigned to the selected app integration.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Assign</span> button next to each user or group for which you want this app assigned. When adding users for some apps, you may need to fill out the user details in the <span class="uicontrol">Attributes</span> dialog.</li>
            <li>Assign more users or groups, or click <span class="uicontrol">Done</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Assigning individual users to app integrations is a time-consuming task, so a best practice is to assign the app integration using groups instead. See <MadCap:xref href="../users-groups-profiles/usgp-assign-app-group.htm">Assign a single app to groups</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <p class="noteContent">You can also convert an individual app integration assignment to a group assignment. See <MadCap:xref href="../Provisioning/lcm/lcm-convert-user-group.htm">Convert an individual assignment to a group assignment</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You can allow users to request and obtain an app through self service by enabling <span class="uicontrol">Requests</span> under <span class="wintitle">SELF SERVICE</span>. You can only do this if your org has enabled self service to allow users to add org-managed app integrations. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-configureorg.htm">Enable Self Service request feature</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Push Groups</h3>
        <p>Group push allows you to use	your existing groups in Okta and push them to the external application. After a group has been pushed to the external application, Okta automatically sends any membership changes to the corresponding group in the external application. See <MadCap:xref href="../users-groups-profiles/usgp-about-group-push.htm">About Group Push</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Group push requires that you enable API authentication and provisioning for the app integration. See <MadCap:xref href="../users-groups-profiles/usgp-group-push-prerequisites.htm">Group Push prerequisites</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3>Okta API Scopes</h3>
        <p>OpenID Connect clients can access Okta APIs on behalf of a user. Scopes control the client access to API endpoints and determine which operations the client can perform. Detailed information on each scope is available by hovering over the tool-tip icon next to the scope name.</p>
        <p>Scopes that end in <span class="code">.self</span> only allow a resource to read or manage itself. Other scopes allow access to all resources of a certain type. For example, the <span class="code">okta.users.manage.self</span> scope allows the app to manage only the signed-in user's profile and credentials, while the <span class="code">okta.users.manage</span> scope allows the app to create new users and to manage the profile and credential information for all users.</p>
        <p>Okta authorizes consent for any scope that you grant consent to, provided that the client makes the request and the client user has the appropriate permission for the resource. A user's Okta administrator role determines their user permission level.</p>
        <p>To enable consent for any scope, click <span class="uicontrol">Grant</span> next to the name of the scope.</p>
        <p>If you need to remove a previously granted scope, click <span class="uicontrol">Revoke</span> next to the name of that scope.</p>
