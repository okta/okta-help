        <h1>Reveal the password of an app integration</h1>
        <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Password reveal</span> feature allows end users to see the passwords of their app integrations. This is especially useful if end users need to reenter a long, complicated, and randomly generated password into another device.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The following conditions are required:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An admin must enable <span class="uicontrol">Password reveal</span> for the particular app integration.</li>
                    <li>The end user must have permissions to manage the app integration's password.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This feature isn't available for end users when any of the following  sign-on options are selected:
					<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Administrator sets username and password</span></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Administrator sets username, password is the same as user's Okta password</span></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Users share a single username and password set by administrator</span></li></ul></li>
            <li>For Secure Web Authentication (SWA) app integrations with <span class="uicontrol">Users share a single username and password set by administrator</span>, only super admins or app admins can view or change the password. </li>
            <li>
						Okta stores the end user's credentials in an encrypted format using strong encryption combined with a tenant-specific private key. When end users click an application tile, Okta securely posts their credentials to the external application's sign-in page over SSL and the user is signed in automatically.
					</li>
            <li>End users can't reveal the password of an app integration configured with shared credentials. </li>
            <li>The revealed password disappears after one minute. To show the password again,  click <span class="uicontrol">Reveal Password</span>.</li>
            <li>If users have been signed in for longer than 15 minutes (or haven't clicked <span class="uicontrol">Reveal Password</span> in longer than 15 minutes), they're prompted to re-authenticate with Okta. The password is revealed after re-authentication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If this feature is enabled for the app integration, end users can do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the End User Dashboard, select the <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> icon on the application tile for the app integration whose password you want to reveal. The settings option opens in the right pane.</li>
            <li>Select <span class="uicontrol">See Password </span>. If you have the permissions to view the password, initially the <span class="uicontrol">Password</span> field is masked.  </li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Reveal Password</span> to display the password. End users can now copy the password and paste it into another device.</li>
        </ol>
    </body>
