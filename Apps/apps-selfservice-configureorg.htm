      <h1>Enable Self Service request feature</h1>
      <p>The Self Service feature takes the burden of granting access to app integrations from your IT staff. Administrators can delegate the process to business application owners by specifying a workflow composed of users or groups who can approve and grant access to requested app integrations.</p>
      <p>After admins enable the components of the Self Service feature, end users can request app integrations directly through their Okta End-User Dashboard. Admins can activate the Self Service components that provide the best fit for their organizational requirements and desired end-user experience. </p>
      <p>An org-managed app integration is an integration  that admins added to the Okta org and configured to work with an external application. The back-end connection between Okta and the external application typically consists of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Federated Single Sign-On (SSO). User accounts can be provisioned to external applications using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol. When an end user clicks the app integration tile on their End-User Dashboard, Okta authenticates the user according to the configured parameters, communicates with the external application, and then signs in the user to the external application. For end users to request an org-managed app integration, an admin must enable the Self Service request option for that app integration.</p>
      <p>There are thousands of app integrations in the Okta app catalog. Some app integrations don't require extra Okta configuration to handle a user sign-in request. The only information exchanged with the external application is a username and password. These credentials are set by the end user the first time that they click the app integration tile. End users can add this type of app integration as a personal app integration.</p>
      <p>Finally, end users can send an email to an org admin and request the addition of an app integration to the org. This app integration may be found in the app catalog or it may require creating a brand new app integration. However, as new integrations typically require back-end configuration between Okta and the external application, users can't add these as personal app integrations.</p>

         <a name="add_org-managed_apps"/>Allow users to add org-managed app integrations</h3>
      <p>This option allows users to add org-managed app integrations to their End-User Dashboard. End users can click <span class="uicontrol">Add apps</span> on their dashboard to add these org-managed apps. A user can request any app integration that your org has added and has the Self Service feature enabled. </p>
      <p>You can view the app integrations that have the Self Service feature enabled on the <span class="menucascade">
            <span class="uicontrol">Applications</span>
            <span class="uicontrol">Self Service</span>
         </span> page. To add an app integration to the <span class="wintitle">Available Apps</span> list, go to the <span class="wintitle">Assignments</span> tab for the app integration and configure the <span class="wintitle">Self Service</span> option. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-configureapprovalflow.htm">Configure Self Service approval workflow</MadCap:xref>.</p>
      <p>The <span class="wintitle">Approval</span> column of the <span class="wintitle">Available Apps</span> pane indicates if further approval is required before the app integration can be assigned to the end user:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <span class="uicontrol">On</span>: This means that the end user must submit a request through their <span class="uicontrol">Add apps</span> interface and an admin or assigned approver evaluates and approves the request.</li>
         <li>
            <span class="uicontrol">Off</span>: This means that the end user doesn't require approval to get access to the app integration. Okta adds the app integration to their dashboard. No involvement from an admin or an assigned approver is required.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
         <a name="add_personal_apps"/>Allow users to add personal app integrations</h3>
      <p>This option allows users to add a personally configured app integration, which means the external application doesn't require Okta to manage the sign-in request. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> passes only the username and password to the external application. End users set these values  when they click the app integration tile for the first time.</p>
      <p>An end user can add any app from the Okta app catalog that isn't already managed by their org and that only requires a username and password for account creation.</p>
      <h3>
         <a name="email_technical_contact"/>Allow users to email "Technical Contact" to request an app integration</h3>
      <p>This option allows an end user to request the addition of an app integration to the org by sending an email to a technical contact configured by admins.</p>
      <p>Before selecting this option, make sure that you've configured the email alias for the Technical Contact. To change the technical contact used in this request:<br/>

         <li>On the <span class="wintitle">End User Support</span> pane, click <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span>.</li>
         <li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Technical contact</span> field, enter the name or email address of the individual account that receives the end user requests to add app integrations. The user account must exist in your Universal Directory with a valid email address.</li>
         <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When enabled, this option adds a button labeled <span class="uicontrol">Request an app</span> to the footer of the End-User Dashboard.</p>
      <p>When end users click <span class="uicontrol">Request an app</span>, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> displays a dialog containing a text field. End users can then provide details about the app integration that they would like the admins to add to the org. </p>
