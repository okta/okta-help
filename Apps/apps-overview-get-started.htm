        <h1><a name="Applications_Applications"></a>Get started with app integrations</h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> app integrations serve as a configured connection between <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> features like <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.UD" /> and external applications that provide a service, like Zoom or Box. These app integrations on the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta End-User Dashboard" /> are also sometimes referred to as "tiles"&#160;or "apps".</p>
        <p>App integrations can be either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-built, in the case of those integrations available in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network" /> (<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" />).
			</li>
            <li>Custom crafted by admins or developers using the App Integration Wizard (AIW), templates, or bookmarks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Suppose that your organization uses Workday to facilitate human resources management. To <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, Workday is an external application. You can integrate Workday with your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> org by locating the Workday integration in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network" /> (OIN) and providing the required details.</p>
        <p>After configuring the parameters of an app integration, you can assign it to groups or individual users in your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> org and have the app integration appear on their End-User Dashboard. Users click the app integration and are  automatically authenticated and signed in to that external application.</p>
        <p>The Applications page, available through the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Admin Console, allows you to add, create, and assign app integrations to users or groups. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-access.htm">Open the Applications page</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>For details on managing the app integrations and assigning them to end users, see <MadCap:xref href="Apps_Apps_Page.htm">Access and customize app integrations</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="apps-assign-applications.htm">Assign app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Although "application" is a commonly used term, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> generally differentiates between an <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> "app integration" and an external "application" like Box or Zoom.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Single Sign-On</h2>
        <p>Single Sign-On (SSO) enables users to sign on to multiple cloud-based, on-premises, or mobile applications using a single set of authentication credentials.</p>
        <p>After you configure and assign SSO app integrations, end users can sign in to their Okta account and then access their external applications without entering their credentials for each application. </p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> uses the secure connection between a user's browser and Okta-managed app integrations to authenticate the user with one of the supported SSO integration methods: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenID&#160;Connect (OIDC). See <MadCap:xref href="apps-about-oidc.htm">About OIDC app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Secure Authentication Markup Language (SAML). See <MadCap:xref href="apps-about-saml.htm">About SAML app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Secure Web Authentication (SWA). See <MadCap:xref href="apps-about-swa.htm">About SWA app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Web Services Federation (WS-Fed). See <MadCap:xref href="apps-about-wsfed.htm">About WS-Fed app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Also describe:&#160;Single Sign Out/Single Logout, Federation broker mode</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">SAML&#160;apps - pass device context using limited access - not in OIE</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">SAML&#160;apps - pass dynamic authentication context</p>
        <h2>Provisioning</h2>
        <p>The provisioning functionality in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> allows you to manage and automate the exchange of user identity information in cloud-based and on-premises apps and services.</p>
        <p>The protocol used for communication between <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> and external applications is the industry-standard Security Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)&#160;protocol. </p>
        <p>If an external application supports SCIM-based provisioning, then you can configure the associated <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> app integration to include the provisioning features of <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Lifecycle Management. </p>
        <p>See <MadCap:xref href="apps-about-scim.htm">SCIM app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</p>

        <h2>Adding app integrations</h2>
        <p>Admins can add app integrations to their <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> org in several ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The OIN is a collection of thousands of pre-built app integrations that connect end users with external applications. App integrations in the OIN provide connections through SAML, OpenID Connect, SWA, WS-Fed, or proprietary APIs. To see what protocols are supported by a given app integration, admins can search for the external application in the OIN Catalog and review the capabilities for each associated app integration. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-add-applications.htm">Add existing app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Admins or developers who require a custom app integration can use the Okta App Integration Wizard to create a new OIDC, SAML 2.0, or SWA app integration. The final product can be private for use just within your Okta org, or you can submit the app integration to the OIN for potential inclusion in the catalog. See <MadCap:xref href="Apps_App_Integration_Wizard.htm">Create custom app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>If you don't want to create an entirely new app integration, there are some templates available in the OIN that you can use to get your project up and running quickly.</li>
            <li>Okta provides integrations for mobile applications, whether they are HTML5 web applications optimized for mobile platforms, or native iOS or Android apps. Mobile web applications can use industry-standard SAML, OIDC, or SWA for SSO. End users can access any web application in the OIN&#160;with SSO from a mobile device. Admins can create integrations for native applications like Box Mobile, for example, using SAML authentication for registration and OAuth for ongoing usage.
                <p MadCap:conditions="MultiProdPublish.Classic">Okta Mobile uses SSO to extend its functionality to apps on your iPad or iPhone. The Okta Mobile application provides an embedded Okta browser and app menu. You can download and install the Okta Mobile app from the Apple App store. For more information on mobile apps and Okta Mobile, see <MadCap:xref href="../Mobile/Apps_Okta_Mobile.htm">Use Okta Mobile</MadCap:xref>.</p></li>
            <li>For simple authentication scenarios, you can leverage the Okta Browser Plugin or use the bookmark app integration from the OIN. See <MadCap:xref href="../Browser-Plugin/plugin-adding-apps.htm">Add an app from the Okta Browser Plugin</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="apps-create-bookmark.htm">Create a Bookmark App integration</MadCap:xref>.
                <p>The Okta browser plugin enables you to automatically sign into applications that would otherwise require you to manually enter your credentials. For more information on the browser plugin, see <MadCap:xref href="../Browser-Plugin/browser-plugin-main.htm">Okta browser plugin overview</MadCap:xref>.</p></li>
            <li>If end users find an app integration that they want to add to their Okta org, they can submit a self-service access request to have an admin, or an assigned delegate, approve and add the app to the Okta org. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-main.htm">Self Service for app integrations</MadCap:xref>.
            </li>
