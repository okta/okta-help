        <h1>About Office 365 sign on policies</h1>
        <p>Office 365 sign on policies in Okta  add an extra layer of security to your org-level sign on policies. Sign on policies allow you to restrict access to your apps based on end-user's network location, originating IP&#160;address, group membership, and ability to satisfy multifactor authentication (MFA) challenges. With sign on policies specific to the Office 365 app, you can extend the reach of these restrictions  for the following client types that access Office 365 services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web browsers</li>
            <li>Modern authentication clients</li>
            <li>Exchange ActiveSync clients</li>
            <li>iOS or Android applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Okta uses host headers sent from the client and the Office 365 service to make access decisions based on the policies that you've configured. Okta determines the client type by reading the request header. The client, which writes the header, is responsible for its accuracy. You can inspect the headers in the <MadCap:xref href="../../Reports/Reports_SysLog.htm">System Log</MadCap:xref>. </p>
