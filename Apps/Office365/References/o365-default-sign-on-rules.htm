        <p>The Office 365 app in Okta has two default sign on rules. This set of rules is unique to the Office 365 app. It ensures that only more secure clients get access to the Office 365 apps. This set contains the following two rules:</p>
        <h3>Allow Web and Modern Auth</h3>
        <p>This rule is by default set as 1 in priority. It only allows  web browsers and apps supporting Modern Authentication to access the Office 365 app. It denies access to Exchange ActiveSync and clients using Legacy Authentication. </p>

            <p class="noteContent">Make this rule more stringent by modifying the <span class="uicontrol">Access</span> section of the rule as follows:</p>

                    <p>Specify how frequently the user will be prompted to re-authenticate.</p>

        <p>This rule is by default set last in priority. It denies access to all clients from all networks. Neither this rule nor its priority can be modified. This rule acts as a catch-all rule for situations not specifically defined in previous rules. </p>
