        <p>Deactivating or deprovisioning an Office 365 user occurs when they are unassigned in Okta or their Okta account is deactivated. If the app is reassigned in Okta, the user can be reassigned. Enhanced deprovisioning only works with provisioned Office 365 instances and provides a more granular off-boarding workflow.</p>
        <p>The options under the <span class="uicontrol">Microsoft Office 365 user status on deactivation</span> menu allow for granular deactivation and deprovisioning of end users.</p>
        <p>We recommend you to include a 3-day grace period for any action that deletes users. This can reduce the necessity to restore deleted users and their data in Office 365.</p>
