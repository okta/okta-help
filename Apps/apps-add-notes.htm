        <h1>Add notes to an app integration</h1>
        <p>You can add notes to app integrations during creation or at any later time in order to communicate with end users and other admins. In addition to enhancing deployment and usage, app integration notes can also reduce help desk calls, provide troubleshooting assistance, and increase end-user self service.</p>
        <p>Notes facilitate the following types of communications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Application notes to end users: Allows admins to present helpful information to end users, such as the purpose of the application, who to contact for help, and links to pertinent information.</li>
            <li>Application notes to  admins: Allows admins to share administrative details about app integrations with other Super, App, Read-only, and Mobile admins. </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>Click the app integration in which you want to add notes.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">General</span> tab.</li>
            <li>For end users, enter your text in the <span class="uicontrol">Application notes for end users</span> field. If an app integration has notes for end users, the text appears on the app integration's settings panel displayed on end user dashboards.</li>
            <li>For administrators, enter your text in the <span class="uicontrol">Application notes for admins</span> field. This text is available to admins on this app integration's settings page.</li>
            <li>Click Save.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="noteOkta">

                <li>To enter a link or an email address, simply type it in the field. These are converted to links in the note after you save it. Supported link protocols are http, https, and ftp.</li>
                <li>Admin-to-admin notes are visible only to Super, App, Read-only, and Mobile admins.</li>
