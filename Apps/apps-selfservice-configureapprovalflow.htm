        <h1>Configure Self Service approval workflow</h1>
        <p>After the Self Service feature is enabled, configure the approval workflow to give business application owners the ability to grant user access and assign entitlements. This action shifts the work of handling user app requests from your IT group to business application owners.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">This workflow can't be used with apps that have required personal attributes.</p>

        <h2>About admin roles for this task</h2>
        <p>You must have at least one of the following roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Super admin</li>
            <li>App admin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Read-only admins can view the approval workflow for individual app integrations but can't make any changes.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin
        </h2>
        <p>The super admin must enable the Self Service feature globally. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-configureorg.htm">Configure your org for Self Service</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Start this task<br /></h2>
        <p>To configure an app integration so that  users can add it with the Self Service feature:</p>

            <li>
