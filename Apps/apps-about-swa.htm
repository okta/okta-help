        <h1>SWA app integrations</h1>
        <p>Secure Web Authentication (SWA) is an Okta technology that provides Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality to external web applications that don't support federated protocols. These include Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Web Services Federation (WS-Fed), or OpenID Connect (OIDC). </p>
        <p>Administrators can set the credentials for the application, or the end user can enter a specific username and password. Okta keeps the credentials for that application inside a secure store, encrypted with strong AES-256 encryption. After setting the credentials, end users only need to authenticate with Okta, and then they can SSO directly into the application. </p>
        <p>Admins can make the SWA credentials match the user's Okta credentials by configuring the sign-in options for that SWA app integration. </p>
        <p>If the admins don't set the credentials, then Okta prompts users to enter their username and password the first time they launch the app integration. If the sign-in request fails, they need to verify their credentials for that external application and try again.</p>
        <p>After signing in, the user clicks the app integration icon on their dashboard. Okta populates the username and password and securely posts the credentials over SSL to the application's sign-in page. The external application automatically signs the user in.</p>
        <p>Admins can browse the <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/?capability=swa" target="_blank">OIN catalog</a> and set the filter to search for app integrations with SWA as a functionality. When added to an org and assigned to an end user by an admin, the SWA-enabled app integration appears as a new icon on the End-User Dashboard.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">SSO for Active Directory-Authenticated Web Apps</h4>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">You can integrate on-premises web apps with Okta. On-premises web apps that use Active Directory (AD) credentials for authentication don't use Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA). Instead, users must enter their AD credentials when they sign in on a browser. When you configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD, signing in to internal web apps can also be automated.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Here's how Okta enables SSO for AD-authenticated internal web applications:</p>
        <ol MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
            <li>Configure Okta to delegate authentication to AD.</li>
            <li>Customer has on-premises apps authenticating to AD.</li>
            <li>Users sign in to Okta with AD credentials.</li>
            <li>Users access their internal web apps with SWA using AD credentials.</li>
            <li>The internal web apps authenticate users against AD.</li>
        </ol>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Okta uses SWA to automatically sign in users to internal web apps. When you configure an internal web application to delegate authentication to AD (the same source to which Okta delegates authentication), Okta captures the user’s AD password during the sign-in process and automatically sets that password for that user in any applications that also delegate to AD. This enables users to click a link to access these apps, and then sign in automatically. Okta synchronizes the AD password securely. If the password is later changed in AD, this event is captured by Okta during the sign-in process and immediately updated in the secure password store for that app, ensuring that the next sign-in attempt is successful.</p>
