            <p class="noteContent">Deleting an app integration is permanent. After you delete an app integration, you can't reactivate it or retrieve its memberships. </p>

        <p>You can permanently delete an app integration using the following method:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/task steps/Applications_Applications.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>If the app you want to delete permanently is currently on the <span class="uicontrol">ACTIVE</span> tab, you need to deactivate it first. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-deactivate.htm">Deactivate app integrations</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">INACTIVE</span> tab.</li>
            <li>From the dropdown menu adjacent to your app integration, choose <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">You can also delete an app integration by calling the <span class="code">delete</span> endpoint of the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Apps API.
