        <h1>Self Service for app integrations</h1>
        <p>The Self Service feature is a workflow through which users can request access to Okta app integrations or add personal app integrations to their End-User Dashboard. The process provides Single Sign-On (SSO)&#160;access to the associated external applications.</p>
        <p>This feature also enhances the Okta Lifecycle Management product. Typically, an org's IT team automates account provisioning when new users are brought on board, but they don't manage the job-specific apps those users need.  The workflow component of the Self Service feature allows business application owners to assign required app integrations and provision the necessary accounts in external applications to users. Delegating approvals to business application owners enables the IT&#160;team to focus their efforts on other tasks.</p>
        <p>With the Self Service feature, admins can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a multiple-step approval workflow with designated individuals or groups.</li>
            <li>Customize timeout rules for the approval process.</li>
            <li>Create customized notification messages.</li>
            <li>Add comments and notes about app integrations.</li>
            <li>Designate a set of app integrations that users can add to their home page without further approval.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Self Service page</h2>
        <p>The Self Service page allows admins to specify which kinds of app integrations  users can add to their End-User Dashboard. It also shows all the app integrations currently available for users to request and any personal app integrations added by  users.</p>
        <p> In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard" />, go to <span class="uicontrol">Applications</span> &gt;&#160;<span class="uicontrol">Self Service</span> to see the feature details. There are two tabs on the page:&#160;<span class="wintitle">Settings</span> and <span class="wintitle">Usage</span>.</p>
        <h3>Settings</h3>
        <p><span class="wintitle">User App Requests</span>:&#160;This pane shows which configuration settings of the feature are enabled. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-configureorg.htm">Enable Self Service request feature</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p><span class="wintitle">Available Apps</span>:&#160;Each app integration shown in this table is configured to work with your Okta org. Users can request to add the app integration to their dashboard. The <span class="wintitle">Approval</span> column indicates whether the request requires permission from the approval workflow. See <MadCap:xref href="apps-selfservice-configureapprovalflow.htm">Configure Self Service approval workflow</MadCap:xref>. </p>
        <h3>Usage</h3>
        <p><span class="wintitle">User Added Applications</span>:&#160;This pane displays the list of all personal app integrations in the org and how many users have added each one. Use the <span class="uicontrol">Allow users to add personal apps</span> option on the <span class="wintitle">Settings</span> tab to control whether users can add personal app integrations.</p>
