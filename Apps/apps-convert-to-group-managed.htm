        <h1>Convert app integrations from individually owned to group managed</h1>
        <p>You can convert the access and user properties settings so that app integrations are managed and assigned through a group instead of individuals. </p>
        <p>Converting assignments has the following effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User properties are managed by the group. Changes at the group level are applied to all users managed by the group.</li>
            <li>Application access is managed by the group. Removing an app integration from the group removes the app integration from the user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can determine whether a user's application assignment is managed individually or by group when you select the user on the <span class="wintitle">People</span> page. The assignment displays either as <span class="wintitle">Individual</span> or shows the group name.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>You must have assigned the app integration to an existing group before you can convert any individual assignments.</p>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p>To convert app integration assignments from individual to group, do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/task steps/Applications_Applications.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>From the list of app integrations, find the one you wish to convert.</li>
            <li>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Assignments</span> tab.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Convert Assignments</span>.</li>
            <li>Select the desired users and click <span class="uicontrol">Convert Selected</span> or, to convert all your users, click <span class="uicontrol">Convert All</span>.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Yes</span> to confirm the change. 
					<p>A confirmation message appears that provides the total number of converted users.</p></li>
        </ol>
