        <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Use a noun phrase when providing a description of a product, component, feature, or approach (for example, "Passwords and locking"). Avoid using gerund phrases in titles.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&lt;short description&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Provide a short description that provides just enough information so that readers can determine whether or not they need to read the topic itself. Provide the goal that a user can obtain from the topic. Use no more than 50 words.</span></p>
        <p>&lt;note or tip&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Include an admonition at the beginning of the topic. If the user must first read the information in the topic to understand the meaning of the tip, include it at the end of the topic instead.</span></p>

        <p style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;items and descriptions in an unordered list or jump list&gt; (optional) If you have multiple subjects or subtopics that you want to include within one concept topic, you can include sections to represent an organizational division in the topic.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Include the item in bold, followed by a colon and the description. Use parallel structure and full sentences for the descriptions. Include end punctuation after the description.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&lt;subtopics or subjects with descriptions (sections)&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">If you have multiple subjects or subtopics that you want to include within one concept topic, you can include sections to represent an organizational division in the topic.</span></p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000;">Use sections to organize subsets of information that relate directly to the topic.</p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000;">Use H3 or lower titles to provide the subject or item. Don't include end punctuation.</p>
        <p style="color: #ff0000;">Use parallel structure and full sentences for descriptions. Include as many sections as necessary.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you include sections in a concept topic, no additional elements can follow the last section element.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&lt;note or tip&gt; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Include an admonition at the end of the topic. If the user must first read the information in the topic to understand the meaning of the tip, include it here instead of the beginning of the topic.</span></p>
        <h2><span>See also (optional)</span>
        </h2>
        <p style="color: #ff0000;">If you have other related but discreet concept topics, include them in an unordered list.</p>
