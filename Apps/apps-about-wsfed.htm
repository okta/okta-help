        <h1>WS-Fed app integrations</h1>
        <p>Web Services Federation (WS-Fed) is an XML-based protocol used for Single Sign-On (SSO). Typically, WS-Fed is used to sign on to legacy Windows-based web applications and Microsoft Office 365, where Okta acts as an authorization server or Identity Provider (IdP).</p>
        <p>Admins can browse the <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/?capability=ws-federation" target="_blank">OIN catalog</a> and set the filter to search for app integrations with WS-Federation as a functionality. When added to an org and assigned to an end user by an admin, the WS-Fed app integration appears as a new icon on the End-User Dashboard.</p>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> as <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Provider full name" /></h2>
        <p>Okta supports integrating with WS-Fed applications as an IdP that provides SSO to external applications. </p>
        <p>When users request access to an external application registered with Okta, they are redirected to Okta. As the IdP, Okta then delivers a WS-Fed assertion to the browser. The browser uses that assertion to authenticate the user to the application.</p>

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using WS-Fed, the user attempts to access client applications protected by <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.
            </li>
            <li>Client applications act as WS-Fed Service Providers (SP) and delegate the user authentication to Okta. The client applications send a SAML assertion to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to establish the user session.
            </li>
            <li>Okta acts as the WS-Fed Identity Provider and uses SSO and Multifactor Authentication (MFA) to authenticate the user.
            </li>
            <li>Okta returns a WS-Fed assertion to the client applications through the end user's browser.
            </li>
            <li>The client applications validate the returned assertion and allow the user access to the client application.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <p class="noteContent">Users, client applications, and external IdPs can all be located on your intranet and behind a firewall, as long as the end user can reach Okta through the internet.</p>
