        <p>What should I do if I want to configure multiple Office 365 domains under one tenant?</p>
        <p>You can use <span class="uicontrol">Automatic WS-Federation</span> to configure multiple Office 365 domains in one app instance. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Office365/multiple-domains-support.htm">Federate multiple Office 365 domains in a single app instance</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>However, if you are using <span class="uicontrol">Manual (PowerShell) WS-Federation</span>, you need to configure a separate instance of the Office 365 application within Okta for each domain you have in your office tenant. For example, if you have five domains under your office tenant, you would have five office apps in Okta, each pointed to the same office tenant but set with a different domain. See <MadCap:xref href="../../Office365-Deployment/add-o365.htm">Add Office 365 to Okta</MadCap:xref>.</p>
