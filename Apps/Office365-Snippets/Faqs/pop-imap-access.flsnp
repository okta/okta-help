        <p>Can my users access Office 365 using POP and IMAP?</p>
        <p>They can  but we cannot secure them through MFA since they do not use Modern Authentication. We strongly recommend disabling these protocols in your Office 365 tenant. To disable these legacy protocols in your Office 365 tenant, refer to this Microsoft Support documentation: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2416434/how-to-enable-or-disable-pop3-imap-mapi-outlook-web-app-or-exchange-ac">How to enable or disable POP3, IMAP, MAPI, Outlook Web app or Exchange ActiveSync for a mailbox in Office 365</a>.</p>
