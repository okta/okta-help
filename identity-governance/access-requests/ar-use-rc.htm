        <h1>Use Resource Catalog</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/beta-banner-closed.flsnp" />
        <p>Resource Catalog makes requesting access easy for requesters by allowing them to request resources from the End-User Dashboard. It also makes the configuring request types easy for admins.</p>
        <p>This topic uses an example to show how the Resource Catalog feature improves efficiency and makes the request process more intuitive. Requester refers to a user who submits a request. Approver refers to a user who has tasks assigned to them in a request type. Request assignee refers to a user responsible for managing the request and who is also a member of the team that owns the request type.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Resources are limited to applications and groups for the beta release.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>How <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> work today</h3>
        <p>As an IT admin of an enterprise company that uses Okta, you’ve created groups in Okta and assigned those groups to your apps. These  assignments govern the group members’ access to the apps.</p>
        <p>Users need the ability to request access to resources like apps and groups. You need to control who can request certain resources and what approvals must be gathered.</p>
        <p>To meet these requirements, you had to <a href="https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&amp;id=ext-ar-configure" target="_blank">configure <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /></a>, and create <a href="https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&amp;id=ext-create-team" target="_blank">teams</a>, <a href="https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&amp;id=ext-create-config-list" target="_blank">configuration lists</a>, and <a href="https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&amp;id=ext-ar-create-reqtype" target="_blank">request types</a> (similar to <a href="https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&amp;id=ext-ar-rt-sample">this sample request type</a>) that reference the configuration lists.</p>
        <p>The configuration lists in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> let you recreate the  relationships between apps and groups. You also create complex request types with conditional logic to meet your requirements. Requesters can submit requests to access apps and groups from Access Requests and they can also add apps from their dashboard.</p>
        <h3>After you enable the feature</h3>
        <p>Enable the Resource Catalog feature for your org to make apps and groups requestable from the dashboard. This feature improves efficiency by allowing you to use the existing relationship between the app and the group, app icon, group name, and group description that you defined in Okta.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <ul class="noteOkta">
                <li>The catalog may take a 5–10 minutes to display a newly added resource.</li>
                <li>If you have multiple request types associated with the same option in an app, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> displays the first request type for the requester to enter information.</li>
                <li>Admins and users are automatically assigned to the Okta Access Request Resource Catalog  app.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>Make a group requestable</h4>
        <p>Follow these steps when you create a request type.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> console, use the <span class="uicontrol">Add user to a group</span> action to specify the group directly instead of referencing a configuration list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enable it to run automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select a group that is associated with a single app in Okta.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Requesters see this group (and its description, if available)&#160;as an option for that app. If this is the first time you’ve made a group requestable for an app, requesters see a new app with its icon in the catalog of their dashboard.</p>
        <p>Create a request type for each group that you want to make requestable. Other groups that you make requestable using request types appear as options for the app.</p>
        <h4>Make an app requestable
</h4>
        <p>Follow these steps when you create a request type.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> console,  use the <span class="uicontrol">Assign individual app to user</span> action to specify the app directly instead of a configuration list.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enable it to run automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select an app.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Requesters can select the <span class="uicontrol">Default application access</span> option in the app to request access to the app. When you first make an app or its associated groups requestable, requesters see a new app with its icon in the catalog of their dashboard.</p>
        <p>Requesters can request an app or a group associated with the app only if the following conditions are true:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You’ve referenced the app or group in a request type. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The requester is part of the audience that you specified. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
