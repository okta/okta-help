            <h1>Request Types</h1>
            <p>Request Types are a customizable no-code approach that defines and automates the entire lifecycle of a request. They consist of actions assigned to users at different stages during the request. Each Request Type is assigned to a specific team and allows organizations to create a comprehensive service library to meet user and organizational needs.</p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Every Request Type is made of one or more questions and tasks. Questions prompt users for information either during the creation of the initial request or later in the process. Tasks outline specific actions the system or a user must perform. </p>
            <p>The complexity of an individual Request Type can vary greatly. A simple usage might automatically add a user to a group, while a more advanced usage might need approvals and justifications from multiple stakeholders.</p>
            <h2>Integrations</h2>
            <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> can sync resources from your integrations such as <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.Jira" />, and <MadCap:variable name="workflows_connectors.ServiceNow" />. </p>

                <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2023-06-09T12:16:18.6335776-04:00" MadCap:creator="naini.khajanchi" MadCap:initials="NA" MadCap:comment="delegated flow actions in AR. Add EA disclaimer after the feature name is finalized" MadCap:editor="naini.khajanchi" MadCap:editDate="2023-06-09T12:16:58.3144639-04:00">Use </MadCap:annotation><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> resources like applications, groups, and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Workflows" /> to perform a range of administrative actions. </p>
            <p>Actions involve common tasks like adding or removing users from groups, assigning applications to users, and running delegated flows automatically. These actions have a direct impact on your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> organization and are a powerful way to help automate access requests.</p>
            <p>Before assigning actions or configuration items to a Request Type, admins must manually enable access to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> resources for the related team. See <MadCap:xref href="ar-configure.htm#Sync_Okta">Sync resources from [%=okta-variables.ProductName%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            <h2>Assignments</h2>
            <p>Teams can assign Request Types to specific users, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> teams, or use information from <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to route requests to an Okta group or the requester's manager. This ensures critical requests receive the necessary oversight and allows organizations to simplify decision-making and accountability. This approach ensures that the system routes requests to the correct person.</p>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <ul>
                    <li>To manage task approvals within a Request Type,  use groups instead of teams.</li>
                    <li>If an automated task doesn't complete, check that the questions and other tasks in the request are complete. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> automatically runs the task after a request assignee enters the missing information. Request assignees can also run a delegated workflow manually by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Run manually</span>, or mark the task as done without running the flow by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Mark as complete</span>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Multi-step requests</h2>
            <p>Combine multiple actions to create complex Request Types. Multi-step requests allow an organization to set a chain of events that must happen before a request completes. For example, a request might need approval from multiple departments. Each approval would need a separate approval action from a different stakeholder. Combining multiple tasks into a single Request Type gives oversight and accountability into how and why a request is approved, as well as simplifying the decision-making process to give the total context of the request.</p>
            <h2>Conditional logic</h2>
            <p>Request Types can use conditions to control request routing and actions. This conditional logic is key to creating complex routing paths. For example, a Request Type could require an approval from an HR team before routing a request to an IT team. If the HR team denies the approval, the request would skip IT approval and automatically close.</p>
