        <h1>Resource Catalog</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../Resources/Snippets/beta-banner-closed.flsnp" />
        <p>The Resource Catalog feature improves requesters' experience by making the process of requesting access intuitive and user-friendly. 

</p>
        <p>It integrates the End-User Dashboard with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> so that requesters can see the apps that they have access to and submit access requests directly from their  dashboard. The apps that you made requestable are visible to your requesters in the resource catalog when they click <span class="uicontrol">+ Add apps</span> from their dashboard. They can see the app’s icon, the groups associated with the app, and the group description (if available). They can also search the catalog for the required app.</p>
        <p> 

Requesters can select an app to view the groups they can request access to for the app. If you’ve made the app requestable, requesters also see the default app access option. After they choose an option and click <span class="uicontrol">Next</span>, they may be redirected to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> web app and may have to enter some information based on the request type you created for the app or group.
</p>
        <h3>Use Okta groups with Resource Catalog</h3>
        <p>Use your <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> groups to provide access to apps or specific permissions within an app from Access Requests. This feature makes it easy to make an app or group requestable:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You don’t need to create and maintain configuration lists for each resource, because you can use the existing relationships between the app and group in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can build simpler request types that grant access to only one Okta resource.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You can use the app’s metadata such as icon, group name, and group description that’s already defined in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limitations </h3>
        <p>Consider the following limitations for the Beta release:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>An app or a group associated with the app is requestable only if you’ve referenced the app or group in a request type.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Only groups assigned to a single app can be made requestable. This means that you can’t use groups that aren’t assigned to an app or are assigned to more than one app.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A requestable group isn't available as an option for the app if the group isn’t assigned to an app or is assigned to more than one app.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Entitlement values and bundles aren't supported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You must create a request type for each group to make it requestable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The resource catalog may take 5–10 minutes to display a newly added resource.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Requesters can't submit requests using Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email after you enable the Resource Catalog feature. However, requests can still be approved or discussed using Slack, Microsoft Teams, and email in addition to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> web app.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The existing app self-service workflow from the End-User Dashboard is unavailable if your org has the Resource Catalog feature enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The self-service option, located on the <span class="wintitle">Assignments</span> tab of the app's profile page, doesn’t have any impact on the app’s availability on the End-User Dashboard.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limits </h3>
