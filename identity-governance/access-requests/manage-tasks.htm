            <h1>Manage tasks</h1>
            <p>Approvers need clear visibility and context for requests, so they understand what to approve and for whom. When a requester submits a request, tasks are assigned automatically to approvers based on the Request Type’s configuration. Approvers can view request details like request type, assignee, team, tags, and followers. Approvers who are a part of the team that owns the request type or are also request assignees can also modify the request. They can chat with the requester from within a request.</p>
            <h2>Manage tasks from the Access Requests web app</h2>
            <p>To approve or deny a task from the Access Requests web app, approvers can follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Approvers go to the Okta Access Requests web app from their End-User Dashboard.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>They select <span class="uicontrol">Inbox</span> and go to the <span class="uicontrol">Open</span> tab to view tasks awaiting approval.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>They select a request and review the request details.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Optional. They review the following information provided by the requester from the central pane:</p>
                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>
                            <p>Responses submitted by the requester from the <span class="uicontrol">Questions</span> section on the <span class="uicontrol">Actions</span> tab.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The activity log from the <span class="uicontrol">Activity</span> tab.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Notes in the chat from the right panel of the request. Approvers can also ask the requester for more information in the chat.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>They select the appropriate option to approve or deny the request. The choices vary based on the task type:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Approval tasks: They click <span class="uicontrol">Approve</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Deny</span>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Custom tasks: They click <span class="uicontrol">Complete</span>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Action tasks: They click <span class="uicontrol">Run</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Mark as complete</span>. If they click <span class="uicontrol">Mark as complete</span>, the task is resolved without any action being taken in Okta.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>After approvers take action on a task, Okta moves the request to the <span class="uicontrol">Pending</span> tab if the request is awaiting an automated action.</p>
            <div class="noteOkta">
                <p class="noteContent">If an automated task doesn't complete, request assignees can check that the questions and other tasks in the request are complete. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> automatically runs the task after a request assignee enters the missing information. They can run a delegated workflow manually by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Run manually</span> or mark the task as done without running the flow by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Mark as complete</span>.</p>
