        <h1>Submit requests by email </h1>
        <p>Each team is automatically assigned an email address. Requesters can contact a team's email to create requests if you have one or more active Request Types. </p>
        <p>For example, a requester can email finance-team@akto.com to create a request for the Finance team. They can also review the email request from their <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> web app. </p>
        <p>If an email request doesn't have enough information or the system is unable to determine a Request Type, the requester receives an email prompting them to finish submitting the request from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> web app. </p>

Kind of seems implied, but I'm wondering what that would look like exactly, Maybe needs some elaboration. If they can only use the web app to cancel, we should say that. If cancel by email, good to be explicit:\r\nE.g.: &quot;..cancel a submitted request in a separate email ...&quot;\r\n\r\nNK - good catch! clarified that they can only cancel from the web app" MadCap:editor="naini.khajanchi" MadCap:editDate="2023-06-19T16:06:19.5385366-04:00">cancel a submitted request</MadCap:annotation> from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> web app, if a team member or approver hasn't taken any action on it. They receive a notification about the cancellation based on the notification preferences that they’ve set up.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> also cancels a request if the requester's access to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> web app is revoked or their status in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> changes to suspended or deactivated.</p>
