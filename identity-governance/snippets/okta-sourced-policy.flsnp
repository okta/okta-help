        <p>In Okta-sourced groups, entitlements are granted only when a user meets the conditions of a policy rule. If a user meets the conditions of more than one rule, that combination determines their entitlements. If their profile attributes or group memberships change and they no longer meet the conditions, the entitlements are revoked.</p>
