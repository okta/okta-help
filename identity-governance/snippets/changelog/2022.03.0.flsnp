                            <h3>Identity Governance</h3>
                            <p>Okta Identity Governance is a SaaS-delivered, converged, and intuitive Identity and Access management platform. Use it to simplify and manage your identity and access lifecycles across multiple systems and improve the overall security of your company.</p>
                            <p>Use Okta Identity Governance solutions, such as Access Certifications, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" />, and Reports to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Efficiently create, protect, and audit access to critical resources.</li>
                                <li>Improve your company’s security.</li>
                                <li>Increase employee productivity.</li>
                                <li>Improve IT efficiency by automating tasks to reduce the time taken and errors associated with manual data entry and provisioning tasks.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Access Certifications</h4>
                            <p>Use Access Certifications to periodically create reviews of your users' access to applications or groups in Okta. Reviewers can approve or revoke access or reassign the review item to another user directly in the Okta Admin Console. Once the reviewer makes a decision, the remediation of a user's access begins automatically. This ensures that only users who need a resource have access to it and there is no accumulation of elevated or privileged access to a resource. </p>

                            <h4>Access Requests</h4>
                            <p>Use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> to automate the process of requesting access to applications and resources. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /> delivers a streamlined and frictionless approach that automatically routes user requests to one or more reviewers for action.</p>

                            <h4>Reports</h4>
                            <p>
							Use Access Certifications Campaigns reports, such as, Campaign Details and Campaign Summaries to obtain information on previously completed campaigns. You can also export the reports from Okta. </p>
