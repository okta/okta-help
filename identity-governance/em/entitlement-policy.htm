        <h1>Entitlement policy</h1>
        <p>An entitlement policy allows you to automatically assign entitlements to your users based on their latest profile attributes and group memberships, which improve the security of your org. Entitlement policies also enable you to simplify your Universal Directory setup because you no longer need to use groups to govern user application entitlements.</p>
        <p>Each application can only have one active entitlement policy. However, you can create multiple rules within a policy that govern how the entitlements are granted to your users. Use the user-<MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2023-08-21T17:09:32.1556804-06:00" MadCap:creator="Mark Cowan" MadCap:initials="MEC" MadCap:comment="This change ok?

                <p>If the entitlement only has one value, then the first rule that matches sets the entitlement value for the user. If the entitlement has multiple values, then the union of all rules that match sets the entitlement value for the user.</p>

            <li>
                <p>By default, when you first add a rule, it creates a draft policy. After creating rules, you can preview how the policy will impact entitlement assignments for users before you apply the policy to activate it.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Editing a policy creates a draft copy of the active policy where you can make changes without affecting users immediately. You must apply the policy to set it to active.</p>
