        </h3>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Governance Engine" /> allows you to discover and import app entitlements into Okta from your SaaS apps and manage them from your Admin Console. You can  perform the following tasks: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Manage user entitlements through policy, app assignment, or individual assignment
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Allow your users to request entitlement bundles with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Requests" /><![CDATA[
]]></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Authorize what a user can access for an app</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Audit user entitlements with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AC" /></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Entitlements</h3>
        <p>An entitlement is a permission, privilege, or access level that allows users to perform specific actions in an app. After you enable <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Governance Engine" />, you can manage your user’s entitlements in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. You can assign entitlements to your individual users from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard" /> or set up policy rules to automatically assign entitlements. </p>
        <p>For provisioning-enabled apps like Box, Google Workspace, NetSuite, Microsoft Office 365, and Salesforce, Okta connectors provision entitlements to the downstream apps.</p>
        <p>You can also group entitlements together to create entitlement bundles.</p>
        <h3>Entitlement bundles</h3>
        <p>Entitlement bundles are groups of related entitlements that you can manage and assign together. You must configure Request Types in the Access Requests console to assign entitlement bundles to your users. </p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">Users must request entitlement bundles through Access Requests. </p>
            <p class="noteContent">You can’t assign entitlement bundles directly to your users from the Okta Admin Console, but you can use APIs to assign them. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2023-08-19T17:03:28.0629424-04:00" MadCap:creator="naini.khajanchi" MadCap:initials="NA" MadCap:comment="NK to check with Brian abotu this link before launch. \r\n\r\nPut this in DNP because curently the beta api site doesn't have any info around this.\r\n\r\nOnce apis are avaialbe, remove the previous sentence and replace it with this " MadCap:editor="naini.khajanchi" MadCap:editDate="2023-09-11T11:15:04.1840054-04:00">See </MadCap:annotation><a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.api/tag/Grants/" target="_blank">Okta Identity Governance API</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Entitlement policy</h3>
        <p>An entitlement policy allows you to automatically assign entitlements to your users based on their profile attributes and group memberships. This improves the security of your org, because entitlements are assigned to users based on their latest profile attributes. It also enables you to simplify your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.UD" /> setup because you no longer need to use groups to govern users’ app entitlements.
</p>
        <p>Each app can only have one active entitlement policy. However, you can create multiple rules within a policy that govern how the entitlements are granted to your users. You can preview how the policy will affect entitlement assignments for users before you apply the policy to activate it. </p>
