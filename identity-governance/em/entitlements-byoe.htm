        <h1>Use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Entitlement Management" /> without out-of-the-box governance support</h1>
        <p>You can use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Entitlement Management" /> with governance-enabled apps that don't have updated connectors to support entitlements by using one or more of the following approaches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Workflows: Use Workflows to build entitlements discovery, support user and entitlement provisioning to the app, and to create entitlements and entitlement bundles. Implement this functionality using a combination of Okta events and APIs. This approach requires a custom connection, because the Okta Connector doesn't yet recognize new entitlement scopes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Partners: Use a connector built by an Okta partner.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Build your own with SCIM: Use the upgraded Okta SCIM integration platform to build your own connector to support entitlements and LCM functionality for their app.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
