        <p>It’s important to periodically review users who have access to your org's critical resources. This ensures that only users who need a resource have access to it, and it avoids the accumulation of elevated or privileged access to a resource.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AC" /> lets you  create audit campaigns to periodically review your users' access to resources and approve or revoke access automatically when required. Campaigns help ensure that your users have the right level of access to apps and groups.</p>
        <p>You can include entitlements and bundles assigned to a user in a campaign. Both resource campaigns and user campaigns support reviewing entitlements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Resource campaign: The <span class="uicontrol">Review entitlement</span> option is available if you have an app with Governance Engine enabled in your org and you’ve selected <span class="uicontrol">Application</span> as a resource in the campaign.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>User campaign: The <span class="uicontrol">Review entitlement</span> option is available if you have an app with Governance Engine enabled and you’ve selected the resource as <span class="uicontrol">All apps and groups</span> or <span class="uicontrol">All apps</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">Reviewers can see any entitlements or bundles associated with the resource and how they were assigned to the users for a review item.</p>
        <p>If the campaign creator has included entitlements in the campaign, then reviewers can also see the entitlements or bundle associated with the resource and how the entitlement or bundle was assigned to the user for a review item. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2023-08-21T11:27:18.8877883-05:00" MadCap:creator="Graham Smith" MadCap:initials="GS" MadCap:comment="This feels like it restates the previous sentence without any new info. Recommend cutting for simplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNK: I am hesitant to similify it to  'see' bcs they can also take action on entitlements - approve/revoke. While entitlements aren't a 'resource' they are treated as one from a campaign perspective. \r\n\r\nAlso, an admin and campaign creator can be two different users..." MadCap:editor="naini.khajanchi" MadCap:editDate="2023-08-31T21:36:08.8963859-04:00">They</MadCap:annotation> can review access to entitlements and bundles in a similar manner as they review user’s access to apps and groups. They can revoke an entitlement or bundle as individual units, but they can’t revoke a specific entitlement that’s a part of a bundle assigned to the user. Reviewers must manually remediate any entitlements that were assigned to a user by a policy rule.
