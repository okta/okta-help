        <h1>View previously completed campaigns</h1>
        <p>You may want to view previously closed campaigns for context in future campaigns, or view and export them for audit purposes. You can view campaigns that were completed in the last 12 months from the <span class="wintitle"><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AC" /></span> page. However, if you need to view and export details of campaigns that were closed in the last 15 months, you can use either of these reports:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Past Campaign Details</li>
            <li>Past Campaign Summaries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You’re signed in as a super admin, org admin, read-only admin, mobile admin, or reports admin.
</li>
            <li>You have some completed <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AC" /> campaigns. See <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-governance/access-certification/iga-ac-create-campaign.htm">Create an access certification campaign</MadCap:xref>.
