        <p> A campaign becomes active on its scheduled start date. When a campaign is active, you can approve or revoke a user’s access to a resource. You can also reassign the review item to another reviewer. You can't change your decisions on review items after submitting them. The campaign is marked as closed on the campaign’s scheduled end date, when all reviewers in the campaign complete their reviews, or when <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2023-03-21T11:07:47.4749512-05:00" MadCap:creator="Graham Smith" MadCap:initials="GS" MadCap:comment="any admin, or YOU specifically?"
