        <h1>Review  campaigns</h1>
        <p>Use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AC" /> campaigns to periodically review users' access to resources. During a campaign, a campaign creator determines the users, resources, and reviewers that are part of the campaign.

</p>
        <p>If you’re assigned as a reviewer for one or more items in a campaign, you’re granted access to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Access Certification Reviews application in your dashboard. You can review and make decisions about a user’s current access in the app.
</p>
        <p>Use the app to approve or revoke a user’s access, or reassign the review item to another user if needed. Your decisions on review items are final and you can’t change them.
</p>

        <h2>Best practices<a name="bp_reviewers"></a></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify your decisions before making them. When you submit a decision for a review item, it’s final and the action takes place immediately.</li>
            <li>Add a business justification to provide context on the decision you made, whether that is to approve or revoke access. This note is visible to you and the campaign administrator. When reassigning a review item, the justification is visible to the user who you reassigned the review item to.</li>
            <li>You can reassign a review item to another user if you think they’re better suited to review a user’s access. Reassigning a review item doesn’t extend the campaign’s end date. The new reviewer must approve or revoke access before the campaign ends.</li>

        <p>If the campaign owner has allowed selecting multiple review items simultaneously, you can also select multiple review items and approve or revoke access or reassign the reviews for the selected items. You can only take one action at a time and the business justification that you enter applies to the selected review items. You can always reassign multiple review items to another user but you must provide a justification for the reassignment.</p>
        <p>You can monitor your review metrics using the counts on the campaign page. In addition, you can reference the items that you have already reviewed from the <span class="wintitle">Closed</span> tab of the campaign’s page. On the <span class="wintitle">Closed</span> tab, you can filter by <span class="uicontrol">Resource</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Decision</span>, and search by a specific user.</p>
