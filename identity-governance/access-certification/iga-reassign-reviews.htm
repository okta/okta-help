        <h1>Reassign review items</h1>
        <p>As an admin or a reviewer, you can reassign a review item to another user. Reassigning a review item doesn’t extend the campaign’s end date. The new reviewer must approve or revoke access before the campaign ends.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../snippets/ac-disable-self-reviews.flsnp" />
        <div>
            <p>Multilevel reviews are reassigned at the current review level. For example, you reassign a review item for a first-level reviewer. The new reviewer is considered as the first-level reviewer. The original second-level reviewer remains the same.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that you’re assigned at least one item to review in an active campaign.
</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Start this task</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>On the End-User Dashboard, click <span class="uicontrol">Okta Access Certification Reviews</span>.</li>
            <li>On the <span class="wintitle">My reviews</span> page, go to the <span class="uicontrol">Open</span> tab, and select an access certification campaign.</li>
            <li>Select one or more review items that you want to reassign to a new reviewer and click <span class="uicontrol">Reassign</span>. You must select review items individually if you reassign to different users. Only admins can reassign items that are assigned to a group or group owner for review. </li>
            <li>Select the reviewer that you want to assign the review items to. If the campaign creator has selected the <span class="uicontrol">Disable self-review</span> option for the campaign, you can’t select a user as the reviewer for their own review item.</li>
            <li>Enter a business justification for the reassignment.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Reassign</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the campaign owner has set up email notifications, the new reviewer is notified that review items have been assigned to them and view the business justification for the change.</p>
        <p>After you reassign a review item, you can view it from the <span class="wintitle">Closed</span> tab of <span class="wintitle">My Campaigns</span> page. Reviewing the reassignment history of previously reviewed items is helpful when you aren’t sure who you should reassign a currently open review item to.</p>
