      <h1>End an active  campaign</h1>
      <p>As a super admin or an access certifications admin, you can end an active campaign before it's scheduled end date.</p>
      <p>Here are some scenarios in which you might want to end an active campaign:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>You need to relaunch the campaign with a different configuration.</li>
         <li>Most the reviews have been completed and the remaining items don't need to be reviewed.</li>
         <li>There's an error in the campaign.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While scheduling the campaign, the remediation options that you configure affect what happens when  the campaign ends. If you select <span class="uicontrol">Remove from resource</span> as the remediation option for when the reviewer doesn't respond and then, manually end the campaign, the system removes all those users from the resource whose access certification wasn't reviewed. See
<MadCap:xref href="campaign-settings.htm#Remediation">Remediation settings</MadCap:xref>. </p>
      <h2>Before you begin</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Sign in as a super admin or access certifications admin.</li>
         <li>Check that you have an active campaign.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Start this task</h3>
      <ol>
         <li> In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard"/>, go to <span class="menucascade">

                  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.AC"/>
               </span>
            </span>.</li>
         <li>Go to the <span class="wintitle">Active</span> tab and select the campaign that you want to end.</li>
         <li>Open the <span class="uicontrol">Actions</span> dropdown and select <span class="uicontrol">End</span>.</li>
         <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">End campaign</span>.</li>
