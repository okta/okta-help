                Additional reviewer type options
            </dt>
                <dd> This feature is now generally available in Preview environments.</dd>
                <dd>While creating or editing an Access Certification campaign, now you can select one of the following options from the <span class="uicontrol">Select reviewer type</span> dropdown menu.<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li><span class="uicontrol">A specific user</span></li><li><span class="uicontrol">User's manager</span></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Group</span></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Group owner</span></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Define using Okta Expression Language</span></li></ul>
            This feature allows you to select a <span class="uicontrol">Group</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Group owner</span> as reviewer types. As a result, you can take the following actions:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Assign reviews to multiple users at the same time to make review decisions when you have multiple application owners or a reviewer might be out of office.</li><li>Leverage the same Okta group that you use in Access Requests in Access Certifications as well. This also minimizes the need to manually update reviewers in campaigns when the reviewers change.</li></ul>

                UI enhancements</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>For Access Certifications campaigns, you and your reviewers now see icons along with the names in the users, group, or apps selection dropdown menus. In addition, for the group selection dropdown menus, you and your reviewers can view the number of assigned users and apps. For apps selection dropdown menus, you and your reviewers can view the app status and the app id.
</p>
                    <p>Since a user, group, or an app name isn't always unique, this enhancement provides more context to you for the resources you select. These enhancements allow you to configure campaigns for the correct users, groups, and applications.</p>
