        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Identity Governance is a SaaS-delivered, converged, and intuitive Identity and Access Management platform. Use it to simplify and manage your identity and access lifecycles across multiple systems and improve the overall security of your company. 

</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Identity Governance builds upon the existing <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Life Cycle management products, such as Provisioning and Workflows, which help enterprises simplify access fulfillment and entitlement tasks throughout a user’s identity lifecycle. 

</p>
        <p>Use <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Identity Governance solutions to perform the following tasks:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiently create, protect, and audit access to critical resources.</li>
            <li>Improve your company’s security by:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Reducing risks associated with unmanaged identities and accumulation of elevated or privileged access.</li><li>Making access certification more meaningful with the contextual information provided by the converged IAM solution, such as sign-in frequency, a resource’s last accessed date, and more.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Increase employee productivity by:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>Automatically provisioning new employees to birthright apps based on their user profile attributes. Thereby, enabling them to be productive from day one.</li><li>Enabling users to self-service access requests to any <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> resource from their workplace collaboration tools.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Improve IT efficiency by automating tasks to reduce the time taken and errors associated with manual data entry and provisioning tasks. Okta Identity Governance uses automated, self-service requests to evaluate who receives access to resources. Approval workflows provide security for your most sensitive data and tools.</li>
