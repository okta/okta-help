        <h1>Import group owner from <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.AD" /></h1>
        <p>Admins can now import the group ownership information from the <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.AD" />(AD) to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Directory using full or incremental imports. The system uses the <span class="code">managedBy</span> attribute in the AD user profile to extract the group owner information. </p>
        <p> AD can have only one owner for a group, either a group or a user, so the imported group can also have only one owner.</p>
        <h3>Manage group ownership of an <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.AD" /> instance</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the Admin Console, go to <span class="menucascade"> <span class="uicontrol">Directory</span> <span class="uicontrol">Groups</span></span>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select a group to open the <span class="wintitle">Group</span> page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Go to the <span class="wintitle">Owners</span> tab on the <span class="wintitle">Group</span> page. You can see the group owners for the group on this tab.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Run a full or an incremental import afterward to get the group ownership information. The group won't have the owner information in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Directory, if the group owner information isn't available at the time of the import.</p>
        <p>To delete a group owner, perform steps 1 - 3 of this procedure, and click <span class="uicontrol">X</span> for the group owner. </p>
        <p>It may take approximately 24 hours for the group owner information to be reflected in Access Requests. Okta recommends that you sync your Access Requests Resources and Configuration lists after you change the group owner. See <MadCap:xref href="access-requests/ar-configure.htm">Configure [%=okta-feature-names.Access Requests%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
