        <h1>About provisioning</h1>
        <p>Provisioning uses the <a href="https://scim.cloud" target="_blank">SCIM protocol</a> to synchronize user account information between your user store and the external applications your users use every day.</p>
        <p> Provisioning saves time when setting up new users and teams, and helps you manage access privileges through the user lifecycle. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> can create, read, and update user accounts for new or existing users, remove accounts for deactivated users, and synchronize attributes across multiple user stores.</p>
        <p>The provisioning and deprovisioning actions are bi-directional, so you can create accounts inside an external application and import them into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, or alternatively create the accounts in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> and then push them out to any integrated external application.</p>
        <p>If provisioning is supported, external cloud and on-premises applications can be provisioned whether they are upstream or downstream of
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. An upstream application is one that sends user data to
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. A downstream application is one that receives user data from
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.
		</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of pre-built app integrations in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network" /> (<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Integration Network short" />) to help you manage provisioning with external cloud-based and on-premises applications.</p>
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>Using <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to provision user account information combines the robustness and flexibility of <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.UD" /> with the security of <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> federated authentication methods.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Account management
				– Use
				<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
			to create and assign user names, profiles, and permissions and bind your users' accounts to a single corporate user ID and password.</li>
            <li>Importing users
				– Import users from Active Directory (AD), Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or certain human&#160;resources apps. You can do a bulk user import, or configure
				<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
			to regularly pull user profile data from a source of truth so your system always has the latest updates.</li>
            <li>Configuring rules and work flows
				– Require specific password rules, synchronize and import groups from external applications, and automatically deprovision users in
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, AD, or LDAP.</li>
            <li>Reports
			– Generate reports and audit trails to determine where changes are required to ensure efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Scenario"></a>Scenarios</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
		provides several methods for handling provisioning in a cloud based environment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AD integration
				– <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> provides a lightweight, on-premises
				<MadCap:xref href="../../Directory/ad-agent-main.htm">AD integration</MadCap:xref>
			to synchronize with your AD configuration. You can set up real-time synchronization and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Just-In-Time provisioning" /> so that you always have the latest user profiles and do not have to wait for scheduled imports.</li>
            <li>LDAP integration
				– <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> provides integration with several popular LDAP vendors using a lightweight agent. The
				<MadCap:xref href="../../Directory/ldap-agent-main.htm">LDAP&#160;integration</MadCap:xref>
			provides real-time synchronization and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Just In Time Provisioning" />, similar to the AD agent.</li>
            <li>HR-driven IT
			– <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> provides automated provisioning from external HR applications (for example, <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/workday/">Workday,</a> <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/successfactors/">SuccessFactors</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/ultipro/">UltiPro</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/bamboohr/">BambooHR</a>, and <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/namely/">Namely</a>). This type of provisioning is useful for companies that want to use their HR systems as a source of truth for their users. Active Directory becomes a downstream provisioning target. This feature provides ongoing profile synchronization and ensures efficient on-boarding.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Deprovis"></a>Deprovisioning</h2>
        <p>The deprovisioning features  increase your organization's security profile by  removing access to sensitive applications and content from people who leave your organization. Deprovisioning a user  automatically removes them from any assigned app integration to which they were provisioned. Aside from the security aspect, deprovisioning is also important for compliance reasons and helps you to maintain an accurate usage count for your external applications.</p>
        <p>You can deprovision a user directly from within
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
		or through AD.</p>
        <p>For app integrations that support the functionality, user access is automatically removed when the user account is deprovisioned. For app integrations that require manual deprovisioning of users,
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
		admins receive a notification for any users that require manual deprovision users.</p>
        <p>Organizations usually have policies to keep deprovisioned user accounts available for a period of time. This is useful if the account needs to be restored at a later time, or if information needs to be retrieved from a deprovisioned account.

				When an assignment is removed (deprovisioned) from a user in
				<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />,
				<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
				does not delete the user’s account. The account is put into a deactivated state in the external application and the user's access to the app integration is removed from
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. Some external applications may support deleting the user’s account in the  external application.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="Who"></a>Permissions</h2>
        <p>A super administrator and an app administrator can assign users to app integrations. The super administrator role assigns a person full permissions.
		</p>
        <p>If
			<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
		groups are utilized, a group administrator can provision users or groups of users to an app integration.</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">

            <p class="noteContent">The
				<MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
