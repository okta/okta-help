        <h1>Set Time Zone Aware Pre-hires/Terminations</h1>
        <p>A worker's termination/activation is processed based on the time zone of the worker's location in SuccessFactors.</p>
        <p>Time Zone Aware Terminations: Okta detects the location of the worker and processes their scheduled termination (based on Termination Date ) based on the associated time zone of that location. This worker is deactivated on the next scheduled import after midnight in the time zone of that worker.</p>
        <p>Time Zone Aware Pre-hires: Okta detects the location of the worker and processes their scheduled termination (based on Start Date ) based on the associated time zone of that location. This worker is activated on the next scheduled import after midnight in the time zone of that worker.</p>
        <p>For example, Cathy is based in Sydney, Australia, and that location in SuccessFactors has a time zone of GMT+10.</p>
        <p>Cathy is scheduled to be terminated on July 4th. If the Time Zone Aware Pre-hires/Terminations feature is not enabled, Cathy's termination would be processed on the next import after midnight UTC as all deactivations are fixed on the UTC time zone (GMT). With the Time Zone Aware Pre-hires/Terminations feature enabled, Cathy will be deactivated in Okta on the next import after midnight in Sydney time (GMT+10). Effectively, Cathy will be deactivated 18 hours prior to when she would have been deactivated in the past.</p>
