      <h1>Troubleshooting tips</h1>
      <h2>
         <a name="Personal"/>Personal folder characteristics</h2>
      <p>With the personal folder creation feature, Okta creates a personal folder for users during provisioning through the admin account. This makes the admin the owner of the personal folder, and a copy of the folder is available in the admin account. The new user can be made either an editor or co-owner. If the user is later deactivated with the option to transfer files enabled, this folder is not transferred because it is not owned by the user. The admin's copy of the folder and its contents remains accessible in their account and is not deleted.</p>
      <p>Personal folders are usually named after a username. If a folder with this name already exists, a user is still created but not a personal folder. A task is generated with an explanation of the conflict. After manually addressing the issue, you may resolve this task to complete successful provisioning of this user.</p>
      <h2>
         <a name="SAML"/>SAML assertions to remove users from groups in Box</h2>
      <p>If you are using SAML assertions from Okta to push user groups to groups in Box, then you can also remove users from groups in Box. </p>
      <p>To configure push groups using SAML to remove group memberships from Box:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>From Box, select  <span class="menucascade">
               <span class="uicontrol">Admin Console</span>
               <span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Settings</span>
            </span> and then the <span class="wintitle">User Settings</span> tab.</li>
         <li>
            <p>Ensure  the <span class="uicontrol">Remove user from groups upon SSO user login</span> check box is selected.</p>
            <p>This option is only available if you have SAML enabled on your Box tenant.</p>
         </li>
         <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="noteOkta">
         <ul>
            <li> If a user is a member of only one group in Okta and AD and is removed from that group, the group membership removal does not occur in Box. </li>
            <li>If a user is a member of no groups in Okta and AD, the SAML assertion from Okta omits the <span class="codeph">&lt;groups&gt;</span> element completely (instead of sending an empty <span class="codeph">&lt;groups&gt;</span> element).  With no <span class="codeph">&lt;groups&gt;</span> element to inspect, Box does nothing to its groups so the last group membership remains intact in Box until you manually remove it in Box.</li>
         </ul>
      </div>
   </body>
