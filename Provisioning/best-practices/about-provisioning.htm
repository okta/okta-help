        <h1>About provisioning</h1>
        <p>Having persons join and leave an organization—on-boarding and off-boarding, is the nature of an organization. When an individual joins an organization, this person needs to added as a member and given access to certain resource, such as apps. Likewise, when an individual is terminated from an organization, this person needs to be removed from the organization and access to assigned resources must be removed from this person. This process is called User Lifecycle Management (ULM). ULM is  comprised of three components: specifying users, determining access, and provisioning. This user guidance focuses on Okta Provisioning.</p>

            <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term0">Provisioning</MadCap:glossaryTerm> is an integral part of the user on- and off-boarding process. Okta Provisioning enables you to manage user accounts automatically within applications. This saves time and ensures that user access privileges are up to date. Okta Provisioning along with Okta Authentication are the two main pillars of Okta ULM.</p>
