        <h1>About Azure Active Directory SAML&#160;integration</h1>
        <p>Typically, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> acts as an identity provider (IdP) and delivers authenticated user profile data to downstream applications. Often overlooked is that you can configure <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to act as a service provider for external IdPs to manage access to downstream applications, including those that are externally authenticated.  For externally authenticated users assigned access to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />-managed resources, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> delivers user profile data to downstream applications as SAML assertions or OIDC tokens.</p>
        <p>Using <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to delegate authentication to shared resources is a common use case for integrating <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> with an external IdP. For example, a company using <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to manage access to applications has a partner who needs access to an application to collaborate on a project.  To reduce administrative effort and password creation, the partner prefers to use its existing Azure Active Directory instance for authentication. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> can use inbound federation to delegate authentication to Azure Active Directory because it uses the SAML 2.0 protocol.</p>
