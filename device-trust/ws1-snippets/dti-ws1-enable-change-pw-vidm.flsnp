            <p>Integrating Okta applications with <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> also automatically enables Okta password management for <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> users. No configuration is required in the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> console.</p>
            <p>In the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> Intelligent Hub app, <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> app, and web portal, end users can change their passwords by going to <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> and clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Change Password</span> link. When Okta applications are integrated with VMware Identity Manager, this password change is automatically handled by Okta, not by <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" />. </p>
            <p>When users change their passwords, password policies configured in the Okta Admin console are enforced. The password policy is not displayed by default on the <span class="uicontrol">Change Password</span> page but appears when users enter a password that does not match the policy. </p>
