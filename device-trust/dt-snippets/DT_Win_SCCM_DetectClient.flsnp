        <p>After installing the Device Trust client on your managed Windows computers, SCCM runs a script  to verify that installation was successful. Make sure to specify either <span class="uicontrol">File System</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Registry</span> in your <span class="uicontrol">Detection Rule</span>. Do not use the <span class="uicontrol">Windows Installer</span> setting type to detect the installation, as SCCM cannot detect the Device Trust client using that setting. </p>
