        <p>Users must re-authenticate after prolonged Okta Mobile inactivity — Users who have not used Okta Mobile for 30+ days are prompted to enter their Okta credentials when they eventually open Okta Mobile. This occurs because Okta Mobile relies on an internal token for authentication that expires after 30 days of inactivity. This token expiration is separate from PIN and MFA expiration occurrences.</p>
