        <p>Beginning with Okta release 2020.02.0 in February 2020, OMC will no longer be available for use. Mobile users will no longer see the 1-click "Sign in with Okta Mobile" option through Okta Mobile Connect.  Instead, users are redirected to the Okta Sign-in page to enter their credentials and set factors. Admins should communicate this change to their iOS-device users who are assigned Box and Workday. <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Okta-Mobile-Connect-Known-Incompatibility-with-iOS-13-Planned-End-Of-Life">Learn more</a>.</p>
