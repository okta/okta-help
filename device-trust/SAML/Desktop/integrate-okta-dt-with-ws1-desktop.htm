        <h1>Integrate Okta Device Trust with <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" /> <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> for Windows and macOS computers</h1>
        <div>
            <p>This <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> + <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> integration for desktop devices is based primarily on <span class="disableGlossary">SAML</span> trust connections. It allows administrators to establish device trust by evaluating device posture before permitting <span class="disableGlossary">end users</span> to access sensitive applications. To determine whether devices are managed and compliant, device posture policies established in <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> are evaluated anytime a user tries to access a protected application.</p>
            <p>You can also configure this integration to provide end users a streamlined device enrollment experience, leverage Okta's extensible Multifactor <span class="disableGlossary">Authentication</span> to applications in <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />, and provide a consistent and familiar login experience for users and administrators.</p>
            <p>This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure and test use cases supported by the Okta + <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />. To integrate Okta with <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />, you integrate <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> with Okta. <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> is the identity component of <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />.</p>

        </h2>
            <p>The main use cases supported by the Okta + <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> integration include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Enforce Device Trust and SSO for desktop devices with Okta + VMware Workspace ONE</li>
                <li>Configure streamlined Device Enrollment and [%=Mobile.WS1%] login for desktop devices using Okta</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>1. Enforce Device Trust and SSO for desktop devices with Okta + VMware Workspace ONE</h3>

            <h3>2. Configure streamlined Device Enrollment and [%=Mobile.WS1%] login for desktop devices using Okta</h3>
            <p><a name="streamlined-device-enrollment"></a>
                <MadCap:xref href="configure-streamlined-enrollment-vmware-login-with-okta-desktop.htm">Configure streamlined Device Enrollment and [%=Mobile.WS1%] login for desktop devices using Okta</MadCap:xref>
            </p>
            <p>You can configure this use case to provide end users a streamlined device enrollment experience, leverage Okta's extensible Multi Factor Authentication to applications in Workspace ONE, and provide a consistent and familiar login experience for users and administrators.</p>
            <p>This configuration is configured in <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" />, the identity component of <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />.</p>
            <p>To configure this use case:</p>
            <div>

            </div>
            <div>Note: If you want to combine both use cases, first configure this use case and then configure Enforce Device Trust and SSO for desktop devices with Okta + VMware Workspace ONE.</div>

            <h2><a name="dti-integration-requirements"></a>Requirements
            </h2>
            <p>Ensure that your environment meets the following requirements before you begin the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />and Okta integration.</p>
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <h4><MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" />
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> tenant with System Administrator role</li>
                <li>A <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-long" /> (UEM) tenant</li>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> Connector </li>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> AirWatch Cloud Connector (ACC)</li>
                <p>ACC is required only if you use Workspace ONE UEM.</p>
                <div>Note: If your existing deployment syncs users to <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> from <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" />, the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> connector is not required. For new deployments, using the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> connector to sync users from Active Directory to <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> is recommended.</div>
            </ul>
            <h4><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>An Okta org (tenant) with Super or Org Administrator role</li>
                <li>Device Trust for <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> enabled by Okta Support</li>
                <li>Identity Provider Routing Rules (IdP Discovery) enabled  by Okta Support</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Supported apps and devices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Any Windows or macOS SAML or WS-Fed cloud app</li>
                <li>Devices running Okta-supported versions of <a href="../../../Miscellaneous/Platforms_Browser_OS_Support.htm" target="_blank">Windows</a> or <a href="../../../Miscellaneous/Platforms_Browser_OS_Support.htm" target="_blank">macOS</a>&#160;operating systems</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Integrate <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /></h3>
            <p>Integrate your <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> tenants and configure the mobile SSO authentication methods that you intend to use for device trust.</p>
            <h2><a name="caveats"></a>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Only SP-initiated authentication flows are supported&#160;– This SAML-based integration supports only SP-initiated authentication flows. IdP-initiated flows (such as trying to access resources by clicking SAML apps on the Okta End User Dashboard) are not supported. </p>
                </li>
                <li>Do not secure Workspace ONE with this Device Trust solution – Doing so will prevent new users from enrolling their device in Workspace ONE and accessing other device trust-secured apps.</li>
                <li>Timeout issue can cause an&#160;SSO&#160;error&#160;– End users signing in to device trust-secured apps from an untrusted device are prompted to enroll their device with Workspace ONE. (This is expected behavior.) But if the apps are native apps and Workspace ONE enrollment takes longer than 10 minutes, or if the end user waits longer than 10 minutes after enrollment before trying again to access the app, an SSO error occurs because the app session has timed out. Advise affected end users to try to access the app again.</li>
