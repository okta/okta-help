        <h1>Integrate Okta Device Trust with <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" /> <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> for <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.mobileplatform" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.UEM-platform" /> devices</h1>

        <div>
            <p>This integration is based primarily on SAML trust connections. It combines the power of Okta’s Contextual Access Management policy framework with device signals from VMware Workspace ONE to deliver a secure and seamless end-user experience. Allowing Workspace ONE to add the Device Context to the SAML Assertion lets enterprises leverage Okta’s policy framework to require users to enroll their unmanaged device or satisfy an MFA challenge. </p>
            <p>You can also configure this integration to provide end users a streamlined device enrollment experience, leverage Okta's extensible Multi Factor Authentication to applications in Workspace ONE, and provide a consistent and familiar login experience for users and administrators.</p>
            <p>This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure and test use cases supported by the Okta + <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />. To integrate Okta with <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />, you integrate <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> with Okta. <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> is the identity component of <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />.</p>
            <h3>Intended audience</h3>
            <p>This information is written for experienced administrators who are familiar with Okta and <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" />.</p>

            <p>You can configure this use case to provide end users a streamlined device enrollment experience, leverage Okta's extensible Multi Factor Authentication to applications in Workspace ONE, and provide a consistent and familiar login experience for users and administrators.</p>
            <p>This configuration is configured in <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" />, the identity component of <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />.</p>
            <p>To configure this use case:</p>

            <h2><a name="dti-integration-requirements"></a>Requirements
            </h2>
            <p>Ensure that your environment meets the following requirements before you begin the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" />and Okta integration.</p>
            <h3>Components</h3>
            <h4><MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" />
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> tenant with System Administrator role</li>
                <li>A <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-long" />(UEM) tenant</li>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> Connector </li>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> AirWatch Cloud Connector (ACC)</li>
                <p>ACC is required only if you use Workspace ONE UEM.</p>
                <p> If your existing deployment syncs users to <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> from <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" />, the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> connector is not required. For new deployments, using the <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> connector to sync users from Active Directory to <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> is recommended.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>An Okta org (tenant) with Super or Org Administrator role</li>
                <li>Device Trust for <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> enabled by Okta Support</li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Supported apps and devices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Any iOS or Android SAML or WS-Fed cloud app</li>
                <li>Devices running Okta-supported versions of iOS and Android operating systems</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Integrate <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /></h3>
            <p>Integrate your <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" /> and <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VIDM" /> tenants and configure the mobile SSO authentication methods that you intend to use for device trust.</p>
            <h2><a name="caveats"></a>Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> does not apply to apps accessed from <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.Okta Mobile" />.</li>
                <li>Enroll devices in Workspace ONE&#160;for best end user experience – Your end users will have a better experience when accessing your corporate resources if their Android or iOS device is already enrolled in Workspace ONE UEM. Otherwise, end users with un-enrolled iOS and Android devices are guided through the Workspace ONE UEM enrollment process before they can access device trust-secured apps.</li>
                <li>Do not secure Workspace ONE with this Device Trust solution – Doing so will prevent new users from enrolling their device in Workspace ONE and accessing other device trust-secured apps.</li>
                <li>Timeout issue can cause an&#160;SSO&#160;error&#160;– End users signing in to device trust-secured apps from an untrusted iOS or Android device are prompted to enroll their device with Workspace ONE. (This is expected behavior.) But if the apps are native apps and Workspace ONE enrollment takes longer than 10 minutes, or if the end user waits longer than 10 minutes after enrollment before trying again to access the app, an SSO error occurs because the app session has timed out. Advise affected end users to try to access the app again.</li>
