        <h2>Why passwordless?</h2>
        <p>Traditional authentication with a username and password has been the foundation of digital identity for over 50 years. With the ever-growing number of user accounts, there are new issues: the burden on users to remember multiple passwords, support costs, and most importantly, the security risks posed by compromised credentials. As a result, the case for eliminating passwords from the authentication experience is more compelling every day.</p>
        <p>Understanding the need for passwordless authentication starts with understanding the core challenges presented by passwords. These are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poor user experience</li>
            <li>Poor account security</li>
            <li>Increased costs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moving beyond passwords requires thought and planning. Before deciding to eliminate passwords, organizations should evaluate threats, technology, user journeys, costs, adoption friction, and implementation.</p>
