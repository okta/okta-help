        <h2>Before you begin </h2>
        <p>Before you deploy <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, consider the following: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The default "catch-all" rule in an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy" /> may not be enough to protect it. Before you enable <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> and delegate authentication to your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policies" />, be sure that those policies are sufficiently restrictive. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Although <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> creates a strong binding between users and their devices, it does not replace a device management solution. For your most sensitive apps, limit <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> to managed devices only. </li>
            <li>If the user loses access to their device (or the device is suspended or deactivated by an <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> admin), it is impossible for the user to authenticate unless other authenticators are available.</li>
        </ul>
