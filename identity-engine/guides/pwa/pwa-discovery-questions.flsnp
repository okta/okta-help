        <h2>Discovery questions</h2>
        <p>Before you deploy passwordless authentication, consider the following questions. The answers to these questions will impact configuration settings and determine the type of passwordless experience you should use.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>When is a user allowed this experience based on device context? Should it include all devices? Registered devices only? Managed devices only? </li>
            <li>What requirements must a sign-in event meet to allow this flow? </li>
            <li>Which types of devices are predominant in the environment? Do all of these have native biometric access? Do you want to enforce biometric flows each time?</li>
            <li>What are your authentication requirements for each app? You should understand <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> assurance levels and how they apply to authenticator types. </li>
            <li>What other factors are allowed in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />?</li>
            <li>Does your organization use <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.AD" />?</li>
            <li>Do you allow users to bring their own devices?</li>
            <li>Do you want a different user experience depending on the device platform (for example, iOS or Windows)?</li>
            <li>Do you want users to be signed in silently, without user interaction? </li>
            <li>Do you want your app policies to apply to users coming in from specific network zones?</li>
        </ol>
