      <h1>Device Registration (Okta Devices)</h1>
      <p>When a user installs Okta Verify on a device and adds an account, the device becomes <span class="term">registered</span> as a unique object in the Okta Universal Directory. This registration binds the user to the Okta Verify app instance on the device, allowing admins to see a list of enrolled devices and change their <span class="term">lifecycle state</span> in the Okta Admin Console.</p>
      <p>All registered devices are in one of three lifecycle states:</p>
      <table style="mc-table-style: url('../../../../Resources/TableStyles/standard-shaded-rows.css');"
             class="TableStyle-srb_header_alt_shade"
             cellspacing="0">
         <tbody>
            <tr class="TableStyle-srb_header_alt_shade-Body-Body1">
               <td class="TableStyle-srb_header_alt_shade-BodyF-Column1-Body1">
                  <span class="uicontrol">Suspended</span>
               </td>
               <td class="TableStyle-srb_header_alt_shade-BodyD-Column1-Body1">This is a temporary state. It is useful to pause (and later resume) device access for users such as contractors or employees who take a leave of absence. Suspended devices can be unsuspended from the <span class="uicontrol">Devices</span> page in the Okta Admin Console. When a device is suspended, these are the consequences:
<ul>
                     <li>All active sessions established on that device using Okta Verify are terminated.</li>
                     <li>Active sessions established without Okta Verify are unaffected until the session ends.</li>
                     <li>New sessions using Okta Verify can't be established.</li>
                     <li>Okta Verify authentication factors can't be used from the device, but users can continue to use password, email, or WebAuthN authentication factors from the device.</li>
                     <li>Users can't add or remove accounts from Okta Verify on the device.</li>
                     <li>Device certiﬁcates are unaffected (applies to desktop devices).</li>
                     <li>The device can't be unsuspended by the user trying to enroll in Okta Verify from the device</li>
                  </ul>

               </td>
               <td class="TableStyle-srb_header_alt_shade-BodyA-Column1-Body2">This state can be used if a device is reported as lost or compromised. A device that is deactivated can be reactivated from the <span class="wintitle">Devices</span> page in the Okta Admin Console. However, reactivated devices must be re-enrolled in Okta Verify.
<ul>
                     <li>All active sessions established on that device using Okta Verify are terminated.</li>
                     <li>Active sessions established without Okta Verify are unaffected until the session ends.</li>
                     <li>New sessions using Okta Verify can't be established.</li>
                     <li>Okta Verify authenticators (for example, Okta FastPass authentication, Okta FastPass with biometrics, temporary one-time password, and Push) can't be used from the device. Still, users can continue to use password, email, or WebAuthN authentication factors from the device.</li>
                     <li>Users can't add or remove accounts from Okta Verify on the device.</li>
                     <li>Enrolled factors on the device are deactivated, and users must re-enroll them when the device is activated.</li>
                     <li>Device certiﬁcates are revoked (applies to desktop devices).</li>
                     <li>If all rules in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy"/> protecting a resource require devices to be registered, a user on a deactivated device is denied access to that resource. If the policy includes rules which allow access from unregistered devices, an end user on a deactivated device might be able to access the resource but not by using Okta Verify.</li>
