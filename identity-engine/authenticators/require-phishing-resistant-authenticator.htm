        <h1>Phishing-resistant authenticator enrollment</h1>
        <p>You can increase the security of your org by configuring phishing-resistant authenticator enrollment.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Configure phishing-resistant authenticators. See <MadCap:xref href="phishing-resistant-auth.htm">Phishing resistant authentication</MadCap:xref>. To ensure that users enroll in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> in a phishing-resistant manner, go to <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Admin Console</span> <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span></span>, and then enable the <span class="uicontrol">Block non-phishing-resistant enrollment methods for Okta Verify</span> feature. This Early Access feature unlocks high-security <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> enrollment options. Select <span class="uicontrol">Higher security methods</span> so that users can't enroll with a QR code, email, or SMS link.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Configure authenticator enrollments to require a pre-existing phishing-resistant authenticator. To turn on this feature, go to <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Admin Console</span> <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span></span> and click the toggle for <span class="uicontrol">Require phishing-resistant authenticator to enroll additional authenticators</span>. With this Early Access feature enabled, users must authenticate with FIDO2 WebAuthn or Okta FastPass before they enroll in additional authenticators.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>End-user experience</h2>
        <h3>Users have no phishing-resistant authenticator</h3>
        <p>Users are prompted to enroll in a phishing-resistant authenticator when they enroll in multifactor authentication  or the next time they sign in to Okta. If users add another authenticator later, they must authenticate with the phishing-resistant authenticator first. </p>
        <p>If a user hasn’t enrolled in a phishing-resistant authenticator, they can enroll in any authenticators that satisfy assurance requirements defined in the authenticator <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2023-09-26T11:04:11.1983024-05:00" MadCap:creator="Graham Smith" MadCap:initials="GS" MadCap:comment="I tried a revision that makes sense to me but I'm not sure I understand the concept. I wanted to emphasize that this paragraph is what happens if they DONT enroll in a phishing resistant authenticator, even after being prompted. Let me know what you think\r\n\r\nAJ: Leavig this sentence as is (approved version) until I hear back from Megha. This needs clarification."

        <h3>Users have at least one phishing-resistant authenticator</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If a user has <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> set up on their device, they can use it to enroll in another authenticator (such as WebAuthn or hardware key) on the same device. They can also use the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> application to enroll other devices by using the <span class="uicontrol">Add account to another device</span> option.

            <li>
                <p>If a user is enrolled in a roaming authenticator such as FIDO&#160;2 YubiKey, they can plug it into any device and then enroll in WebAuthn or <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> on that device.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If a user has a device-bound authenticator such as WebAuthn, they can use it to enroll in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> on the same device. They can then use the <span class="uicontrol">Add account to another device</span> option in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to enroll other devices.</p>
