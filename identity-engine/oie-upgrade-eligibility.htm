        <h1><a name="top"></a>Upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Identity Engine" /></h1>
        <p>Okta provides a self-service upgrade process that helps you easily schedule and manage your org's upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Identity Engine" />.  You must be a super admin to view and manage this  process.</p>
        <p>When your org is eligible for a self-service upgrade, the Admin Dashboard displays a persistent notification to help you get started. </p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent">If you don't see these self-service upgrade options in your dashboard, there may be some tasks that you need to complete before your org is eligible to upgrade. See <MadCap:xref href="../identity-engine-upgrade/pre-upgrade-checklist.htm">Complete your eligibility tasks</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Before the upgrade</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Review <MadCap:xref href="../identity-engine-upgrade/features.htm">Feature changes</MadCap:xref> to learn how <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Classic Engine" /> features change after the upgrade.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Review the <MadCap:xref href="../identity-engine-upgrade/self-service/test-plan.htm">Upgrade test plan</MadCap:xref> to understand how the upgrade affects your org, so you can make adjustments before you go live.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Optional. Create an Identity Engine <a href="https://www.okta.com/free-trial/">free trial org</a> to compare the differences between the platforms.</p>
