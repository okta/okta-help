      <h1>Set up passwordless sign-in experience</h1>
      <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">ENG_ENABLE_OPTIONAL_PASSWORD_ENROLLMENT EA 2022.04.0 GA PRE 2022.05.0 GA PROD 2022.6.0</p>
      <p>You can create a password-optional or passwordless experience for your end users. This makes the sign-up process quicker and also improves security:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Passwords are a common source of security breaches. By making passwords optional or disabling them, you can make users use stronger authenticators such as possession-based authenticators or biometrics.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>By removing the need to set up a password during the self-registration process for an app, you can reduce the friction during the process and thus reduce the number of users who abandon enrollment.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>This setting gets applied at a group level in <span class="menucascade">
            <span class="uicontrol">Security</span>
            <span class="uicontrol">Authenticators</span>
            <span class="uicontrol">Enrollment</span>
         </span>. You can target specific groups in the authenticator enrollment policy to enable users to register and authenticate without having to set up a password.</p>
      <h3>Admin-created users</h3>
      <p>Whether a user gets created with or without a password depends on the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The authenticator enrollment  policy</li>
         <li>The group memberships that you specify when creating the user</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The user receives an email with a link that they can use to access their org and enroll a password if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
      <ul>
         <li> The first matching authenticator enrollment policy corresponding to the specified groups requires a password.</li>
         <li>Admin didn't provide a password at the time of user account creation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The user is set to active and can sign in to their org directly if both following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The authenticator enrollment policy specifies that the user must have a password.</li>
         <li>Admin provides a password.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this case, the user doesn't receive an activation email. They can sign in to their org directly using the admin-provided password.</p>
      <p>The user is set to active upon account creation if the authenticator  enrollment policy specifies that the password is optional or disabled for the user. In this case, the user doesn't receive an activation email and the user doesn't have to enroll a password. The user can sign in to their org directly using email as an authenticator.</p>
      <p>You can find out in <span class="menucascade">
            <span class="uicontrol">Directory</span>
            <span class="uicontrol">People</span>
         </span> whether a user requires a password, based on the user account status as follows:</p>

      <h3>Users registered through self-service</h3>
      <p>Users that don’t exist in the org and are registering through self-service get added to the groups you’ve specified in the profile enrollment policy.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>If the authenticator enrollment policy corresponding to these groups requires a password, then the user has to enroll a password.</li>
         <li>If the authenticator enrollment policy corresponding to these groups has the password set up as optional or disabled, the user can sign up without  enrolling a password.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Before you begin</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>MFA should be enabled in your org.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Users are Okta-sourced. Users can create their account through Self-Service Registration using Profile Enrollment. Or you can create the user accounts. Currently, you can't source users from any other directories such as Active Directory or LDAP.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Best practices</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Before you configure the passwordless experience, ensure that your admins continue to have passwords available. This ensures that  users who don't have a password provisioned don't accidentally get blocked from signing in. To do this:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>Create a separate group for admins.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Create separate authenticator enrollment, global session, and authentication policies for this group.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Set the admin group's authenticator enrollment policy to the highest priority. Drag it to the top of the list of authenticator enrollment policies. The label for  the highest priority policy is 1.</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Similarly, to ensure that only passwordless users can sign in without a password and everybody else is  prompted for it, do the following:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <p>Create a separate group for passwordless users.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Create separate authenticator enrollment, global session, and authentication policies for this group.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Set the passwordless group's authenticator enrollment policy to the second-lowest priority. Drag it to the position just above the default policy in the list of authenticator enrollment policies. This ensures that passwordless users are subject to their authenticator enrollment policy and won't fall through to the default policy.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>The default policy should always require a password as an authenticator.</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Explicitly exclude your main admin account from passwordless policies.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Start this procedure</h2>
      <p>This procedure includes two types of tasks: admin and end user. Once you’ve configured the policies to make the password optional or disabled, you can then create users that don’t need a password. You can also remove the password requirement from the existing password-using users. End users can register themselves through self-service without setting up a password. Existing users can remove their passwords through the End-User Dashboard.</p>
      <h3>Admin tasks</h3>
      <p>You can perform the following tasks to create a password-optional or passwordless experience for your end users:</p>

            <p>Passwordless users synced from another org may have the status <span class="uicontrol">Pending user action. User password selection required</span>. These users receive an account activation link. Once they click the link, they may be required to enroll a password, depending on their group memberships and authenticator enrollment policies.</p>

            <p>RADIUS authentication uses passwords as the primary authentication mechanism. Traditional RADIUS authentication can't be performed with passwordless users. RADIUS can use other factors for authentication when the application setting property Okta performs primary authentication is unchecked. See 2FA Only (Passwordless Mode) in <MadCap:xref href="../../integrations/Okta_Radius_App.htm">RADIUS applications in Okta</MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <p>Currently this feature requires one of the MFA SKUs. If after enabling this feature, you withdraw from your MFA SKU,  then this feature will be disabled too. However, this may cause issues with existing policies. Contact Okta Support if you want to do so.</p>
