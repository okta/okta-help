        <h1>Risk and behavior evaluation</h1>
        <p>Risk scoring and Behavior Detection use data-driven models to evaluate sign-in requests. You can configure how these properties are evaluated and applied in  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policy" /> rules.  For example, you can configure a <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policy" /> rule to evaluate changes in user behavior and to require multifactor authentication if a user signs in from a new location or using a new device.</p>
        <p>By manually configuring <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policy" /> rules to evaluate the risk level and to identify unusual behavior, you have control over the risk level or types of behavior you want to see reported. However, this information can also be useful without being explicitly configured in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policy" /> rules. </p>
        <p>To improve the visibility of this information without requiring manual configuration,  organizations can report the results of the risk and behavior evaluation for all sign-in requests.</p>
        <p>The results of the risk and behavior evaluation are added to the <span class="code">DebugContext</span> in the System Log in a separate <span class="code">LogOnlySecurityData</span> field. For example:</p>
