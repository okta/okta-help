        </h1>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Access Testing Tool"></MadCap:variable> enables you to run simulations of real-world user requests to access an application. The result shows whether the user would be allowed access to the app, and which rules and settings of your configuration were matched to create the authentication and enrollment requirements.  You recreate the settings of a real access request and then run the test.</p>
        <p>This helps you verify whether users or groups can access an app if your policies are configured a certain way. </p>
        <p>You can simulate matches for the following types of policies and rules: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authentication policies</li>
            <li>Authenticator enrollment policies</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policies" />
            </li>
            <li>User enrollment policies for apps</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Configure"></a>Test an access scenario</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the policy that you want to test and make a note of the options selected in its rules.</li>
            <li>In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard" />, go to <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Reports</span><span class="uicontrol">Access Testing Tool</span></span>.</li>
            <li>Select the same options as those configured in the policy that you want to test:<ul><li><span class="uicontrol">Application</span>: Select the application for which you want to test access.</li><li MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish"><span class="uicontrol">Group</span>: Enter the name of the group of users whose access you want to test. Select it from the list when it appears. To add another one to the list, start entering the name of another group and select it from the list. To view users, click <span class="uicontrol">Show users instead</span>.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Username</span>: Enter the username of a user whose access you want to test. Select it from the list when it appears. To add another one to the list, start entering the name of another user and select it from the list. To view groups, click <span class="uicontrol">Specify group instead</span>. If the <span class="uicontrol">Group</span> field appears and you want to switch back to adding usernames, click <span class="uicontrol">Specify username instead</span>.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Device state</span>: Optional. Select a device state that you want to include in the test.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Device platform</span>: Optional. Select a device platform that you want to include in the test.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">IP address / <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Network Zone" /></span>: Optional. Select a network zone or enter a single IP&#160;address and press <span class="wintitle">Enter</span> to include it in the test.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Risk score</span>: Optional. Select a risk score level that you want to include in the test.</li><li><span class="uicontrol">Custom expression (OEL)</span>: Optional. Enter a custom expression in the Okta Expression Language.

            <li>In the <span class="wintitle">Matching policies</span> section, all policies that matched the criteria appear if the test was successful. If the test wasn't successful, there are no matching policies to display. Select the format in which you want to view the results:
