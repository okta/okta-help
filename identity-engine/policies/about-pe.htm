        <h1>Progressive enrollment</h1>
        <p>When companies want more data about their customers, they generally ask for details when customers first sign up for their application. However, asking for detailed information during a first interaction creates high friction and drop-off rates. Customers are wary of sharing personal information. Before adding account information to their profile, they need to build a trust relationship with a new website or application.</p>
        <p>With support for progressively building user profiles built into the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> authentication process, companies can use profile enrollment policies to create custom forms for their sign-in flows. They can collect profile data incrementally as end users engage with the application.</p>
        <p>Information is requested only when relevant to the end user’s activities. These new details are validated during the sign-in process to ensure that accurate information is added to the end user's  <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />&#160;<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.UD" /> profile. 
</p>
        <p>You can also integrate inline hooks into the sign-in process to trigger custom code interactions between <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> and your application. See <MadCap:xref href="../../automation-hooks/inline-hooks-main.htm">Inline Hooks</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>In a progressive enrollment scenario, existing registered end users can sign in using established credentials. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> then evaluates the end user against the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.App sign-on policies" /> in place or, if applicable, the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policy" />. See <MadCap:xref href="about-app-sign-on-policies.htm">[%=okta-feature-names.App sign-on policies%]</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="about-okta-sign-on-policies.htm">[%=okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policies%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> evaluates the profile enrollment policy every time the end user attempts to sign in to an app. If you add required attributes to the enrollment form, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />  prompts the end user for this information during their next sign-in attempt. If an end user is already signed in when you change the policy, they can be prompted for more data or assigned to a new group at their next sign-in attempt.</p>
