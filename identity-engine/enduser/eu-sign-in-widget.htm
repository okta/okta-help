      <h2>
         <a name="Sign-in"/>Sign-in flows</h2>
      <p>The  sequence of a sign-in flow depends on the authentication assurance requirements that you set in your policies. Remember that <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> requires that the authentication assurance specified in both the Okta and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policies"/> are satisfied before it allows the end user to access an app.</p>
      <p>Sign-on policies supply the context necessary for the user to advance to the next step and specifies actions to take, such as allowing access, prompting for a challenge, and setting the time before prompting for another challenge. The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policy"/> defines access globally, across all apps. The <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policies"/> enforce end user authentication in the context of the requested application. The user's location and profile are verified against both policies' group membership and authentication criteria.</p>
      <p>Note the following about  the end-user sign-in experience:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
                When a user is allowed to sign in without a password, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> optimizes the sign-in experience. If the device is enrolled with Okta Verify and a biometric authenticator is enabled, the biometric authenticator is always the first factor used for user authentication.
            </li>
         <li>
                If assurance requires end users to sign in with a password, the password prompt will always be displayed first. This corresponds to any configuration where the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy"/> and password authenticator plus other factor types are defined in the sign-on policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
         <a name="Password"/>Password / IDP / any factor allowed by app sign on rules</h3>
      <p>If any of your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta sign-on policy"/> rules has the primary factor set to <span class="uicontrol">Password / IDP / any factor allowed by app sign on rules</span>, end users see the identifier-first Sign-In Widget as the first screen during their access flow.</p>
