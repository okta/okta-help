        <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Sign-up</span> link doesn't appear in the Okta Sign-In Widget. Any new user with an unknown username is denied access to the application. Existing users who have previously registered can sign in with only the credentials that have previously been established. They are then evaluated by the app sign-on policy or, if applicable, the Okta sign-on policy.</p>
        <p>The Profile Enrollment policy is evaluated every time a user attempt to sign in. If a user is already signed in when you change the Profile Enrollment policy, they may be prompted for additional data or assigned to a new group  the next time they attempt to sign in.</p>
