        <p>App sign-on policies enforce authentication requirements on end users when they attempt to sign in to an app. Each app in your org already has a sign-on policy in place and you can add rules to that policy to customize the level of access.</p>
        <p>For example, you may want  all default <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> users to provide a password, but  you want all <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> users in a designated group to provide both a password and email as authenticators. You can create one rule that challenges default users to provide just a password, and then create a second rule that challenges all members of the designated group to provide password and email authenticators.</p>
        <p>The order in which the rules are evaluated matches the order of the rules on your policy page. If you don’t add any rules, the app authenticates against a default Catch-all Rule. </p>
