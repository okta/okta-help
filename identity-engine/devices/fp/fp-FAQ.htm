                <h3>How do end users get <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />?&#160;Why do they have to enroll with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />?</h3>
                <p>As an admin, you can deploy <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to devices as a managed app. Then, you can ask users to set up an account. When users add an account in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />, the device is registered in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Universal Directory. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> detects the presence of management certs on the device, to attest that a device is managed or trusted.</p>

                <h3>Why is the device status <span class="uicontrol">Not managed</span> although I&#160;set up device integration?</h3>
                <p>Devices are managed if they meet these conditions:&#160;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>The device is registered (enrolled in Okta Verify).

                <h3>Are end users forced to use biometrics with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />?</h3>
                <p>User verification (biometrics) is a configurable option. Admins can set user verification to <span class="uicontrol">Preferred</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Required</span>. This is only enforced on enrollment. Admins can't enforce user verification during authentication using <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />.</p>
                <p>See <MadCap:xref href="fp-enable.htm">Enable [%=okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What happens if biometrics is required with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, but not available on the device?</h3>
                <p>If a device doesn't support biometrics and the organization requires it, the user can't add an account to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />, or use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> for authentication on that device.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>If a user has biometrics set up with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, can they also enroll using a passcode?</h3>
                <p>Pin fallback isn't allowed on Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android devices.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Can I enforce Push on <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> if the end user doesn’t provide biometrics?</h3>
                <p>Admins can't configure the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy" /> to specifically enforce push notifications on <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />, but they can ask for a <span class="uicontrol">possession factor</span>. The possession factor requirement can be satisfied with an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> push notification, sending a one-time password to email, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> without user verification, or SMS.</p>
                <p>See <MadCap:xref href="fp-asop.htm">Configure an [%=okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy%] for [%=okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass%] </MadCap:xref>.</p>

                <h3>Is <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> supported on Linux Desktops or Chromebooks?</h3>
                <p>For desktop platforms, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> is only supported on Windows and macOS. For mobile, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> is available on iOS, and Android.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How does <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> know if a device is trusted?</h3>
                <p>When a user attempts to access an app, if the app requires device context, the Okta Sign-In Widget sends a challenge to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> responds to the Okta Sign-In Widget with the required signals.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Are unmanaged devices supported with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, or is device management required?</h3>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> doesn't require devices to be managed. All functionality works on devices that are managed and unmanaged. Users with unmanaged devices must install the latest version of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> and enroll (add an account to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />) before they can use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />. The management state is a signal that is passed for policy decisions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What happens when I disable <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />?</h3>
                <p>When you disable <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, users can't sign in with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, but they can still sign in with other authenticators that satisfy assurance.</p>
                <p>When you clear the <span class="uicontrol">Okta FastPass (all platforms)</span> checkbox to disable <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />, any <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy" /> with a device condition can no longer be evaluated. This can result in unexpected behavior.</p>
                <p>See <MadCap:xref href="fp-disable.htm">Disable [%=okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass%]</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="fp-configure.htm">Configure [%=okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Is it correct that <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> can't lock users out of their computers?</h3>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> doesn't protect access to the device or operating system.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Does <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> support Yubikeys?</h3>
                <p>No. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> is an authentication method, similar to Yubikey. Yubikey provides extra compliance benefits at the cost of user experience. You can configure Okta assurance policies to require both <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> and Yubikey, or require Yubikey only for apps.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Is <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> FIDO-compatible? Is it a factor?</h3>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> is not compatible with Fast Identity Online (FIDO). <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> is one authentication factor available with the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> authenticator app. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> without user verification (biometrics) satisfies 1FA, and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> with user verification satisfies 2FA. Okta supports FIDO WebAuthn outside of <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" />.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Can I configure <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> for specific <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policies" /> or is it a global configuration?</h3>
                <p>Once you enable <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> at the organization level, all users in the organization are able to use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />. However, you can configure each <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy" /> to specify if <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> can be used for the app.</p>
