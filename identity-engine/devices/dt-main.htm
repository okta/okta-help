            <p class="noteContent"><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> (<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />) is currently only available to customers who had <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> (<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />) and upgraded to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />.</p>

        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> allows enterprises to ensure that devices are managed by an endpoint management tool before end users can access apps from the device. It uses Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) to attest that a device is trusted and managed.</p>
        <p>For mobile (Android, iOS), an endpoint management profile is installed on devices (for example, <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" /> <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" />, <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Microsoft Intune" />, <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.MobileIron" />). For desktop (Windows, macOS), devices are managed by an agent-based endpoint management tool or managed through a mobile device management profile (for example, <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Jamf Pro" />, <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Microsoft Intune" />, System Center, BigFix, <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" /> <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" />). Your organization will have different requirements depending on the endpoint management tools you use. For example, you might require that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any macOS devices accessing <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />-managed apps must be managed by <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Jamf Pro" /></li>
            <li>Any iOS or Android devices accessing <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />-managed apps must be managed by <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" /> <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" /></li>
            <li>Any Windows devices accessing <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />-managed apps must be joined to your on-prem Active Directory and managed by Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM)</li>
            <li>Any hybrid <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.AAD" /> (AAD) or AAD-joined Windows devices accessing <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />-managed apps must be managed by MEM.</li>
        </ul>
