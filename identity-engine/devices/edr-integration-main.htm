        <h1>Endpoint security integrations</h1>
        <p>You can integrate <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> with your organization’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution. When users try to access a protected resource, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> probes their device for context and trust signals and then uses these signals to determine an access decision. Endpoint security integration  extends device posture evaluation by enabling <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to capture signals collected by your EDR client running on the same device. All signals are then sent to the Okta server and evaluated against the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policies" /> that you have configured in the Okta <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard" />.

</p>
        <div class="noteOkta">
            <p class="noteContent"><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> currently supports integrations with CrowdStrike, Microsoft Windows Security Center, and Chrome&#160;Device&#160;Trust. Support for additional endpoint security integration vendors is planned for the future.</p>

        <h2>How endpoint security integrations work</h2>
        <p>Integrating <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"></MadCap:variable> with your Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution allows <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"></MadCap:variable> to serve as a device posture integration layer between the Okta server and EDR vendors that also have services running on end-user devices. When a user tries to access a protected resource, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"></MadCap:variable> probes their device for context and trust signals and sends the information to the Okta server. The server evaluates the information against your Okta <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policies" /> to help inform the access decision.

</p>
        <p>Here's  a high-level description of how it works.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Plugins allow <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to communicate locally with the EDR client running on the same device: 
				<ul><li>Windows: The <span class="wintitle">Windows Security Center</span> plugin is created automatically when <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> is installed on the device. To install the <span class="wintitle">CrowdStrike ZTA</span> plugin, you <a href="ov-install-options-windows.htm#Option">specify a flag</a> in the installation command.</li><p>See <MadCap:xref href="edr-integration-plugin-windows.htm">Manage EDR integration plugins for Windows</MadCap:xref>.</p><li>macOS: The plugin is enabled when you deploy a managed app configuration from your device management solution to targeted macOS&#160;devices. </li><p>See <MadCap:xref href="edr-integration-plugin-macOS.htm">Manage EDR integration plugins for macOS</MadCap:xref>.</p></ul></li>
            <li>The plugin is invoked whenever a user uses <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> as an authenticator to access a resource protected by an <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy" /> that requires EDR signal(s).</li>
            <li><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> captures the signal(s) collected by the plugin and provides these to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> server when requested.</li>
            <li>EDR signals are cached in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> for up to eight hours or until the session times out, whichever occurs first. The cache is updated whenever new signals are processed.</li>
            <li>The <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> server evaluates the signal(s) against the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy" /> and either allows or denies access to the resource.</li>
            <li>If access is denied for any reason:<ul><li>The <span class="wintitle">You do not have permission to perform the requested action</span> message appears.</li><li>A system log message is generated that confirms that the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.app sign-on policy" /> evaluation resulted in denied access. Admins can evaluate the context of the system log message together with information from the EDR dashboard to determine why access was denied.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
