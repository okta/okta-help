        <h1>Managed devices</h1>
        <p>You can ensure that devices are managed by an endpoint management tool before end users can access apps from the device. </p>
        <p>Devices are managed if they meet these conditions:&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The device is registered (enrolled in Okta Verify).

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A user profile associated with the device is managed by a device management solution.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The device is configured for device management in <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Security</span> <span class="uicontrol">Device Integrations</span></span>.
Ensure that this is completed before the user authenticates with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The user authenticated with Okta FastPass from the managed device at least once.
</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For mobile (Android, iOS), a management hint (shared secret) is deployed to the device through a managed app configuration (for example, with <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" /> <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" />, <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Microsoft Intune" />). For desktop (Windows, macOS), management attestation certificates are deployed to the device (for example, with <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Jamf Pro" />, <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Microsoft Intune" />, <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.VMware" /> <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short" />).</p>
