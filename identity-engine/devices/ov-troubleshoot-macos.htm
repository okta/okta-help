            <h1>Troubleshoot Okta Verify on macOS</h1>
            <p>If you encounter issues with Okta Verify on macOS devices, try the following general troubleshooting steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Update Okta Verify to the latest version.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Close Okta Verify and re-open it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Restart the macOS device and then re-open Okta Verify.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Report the issue using the <a href="https://appcenter.ms/sign-in?original_url=%2Forgs%2Feng_mobile-a0ar%2Fapps%2FMOV" target="_blank">AppCenter</a> for macOS.</p>
                    <p>If you aren't able to access the AppCenter, you can collect logs on the device <span class="filepath">~/Library/Containers/com.okta.mobile/Data/Documents/logFile.txt</span>.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Managed devices</h2>
            <p>If the macOS device is a managed device, try the following  troubleshooting steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Open the login keychain to verify that a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificate is installed on the device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check whether Okta is the certificate authority that issued the certificate installed on the device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check whether the certificate was issued for all users at the device level or for an individual user of the device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check whether the private key for the certificate has Access Control set to <span class="uicontrol">Allow all applications to access this item</span>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check the status of the device in your mobile device management software.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check the configuration of the SCEP profile in your mobile device management software to make sure allow all apps access is selected.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that your device management software is set to push managed app configurations to the following preference domains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Preference domain 1: com.okta.mobile</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Preference domain 2: com.okta.mobile.auth-service-extension</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you receive error code 25300 or Failed to create Identity reference for given certificate, this indicates that the SCEP certificate was not installed correctly. Delete the certificate and reinstall it.</p>
            <h2>Endpoint detection and response integration</h2>
            <p>If your endpoint detection and response integration is not working as expected, try the following  troubleshooting steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that the software you are integrating with is installed and configured correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that the software you are integrating with supports managed app configuration.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify the Okta plugin for the integration  was successfully deployed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check that the device is not registered using the same certificate in another Okta org.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that your device management software is set to push managed app configurations to the following preference domains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Preference domain 1: <span class="url">com.okta.mobile</span></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Preference domain 2: <span class="url">com.okta.mobile.auth-service-extension</span></p>
                        </li>
