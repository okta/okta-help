      <h1>Device assurance</h1>
      <p>With device assurance policies you can check sets of security-related device attributes as part of your authentication policies. For example, you can configure a device assurance policy to check whether a specific operating system version or security patch is installed on a device before that device can be used to access Okta-protected resources. By adding device checks to authentication policy rules, you can establish minimum requirements for the devices that have access to systems and applications in your organization.</p>
      <p>After you add at least one device assurance policy, you can include it  in authentication policy rules. You can't apply device assurance policies to users, groups, or devices until you make them part of an authentication policy rule.</p>
      <p>Users who have at least one Okta Verify enrollment can check the security health of their devices by opening Okta Verify and going to <span class="menucascade">
            <span class="uicontrol">Menu</span>
            <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span>
            <span class="uicontrol">Device health</span>
         </span>. This feature is available in the following  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"/> versions or later: </p>

      <h2>Device health</h2>
      <p>If the device passes all checks, each security requirement has a green check mark. </p>
