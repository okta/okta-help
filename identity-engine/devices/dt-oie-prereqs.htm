         <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust"/> on <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> prerequisites</h1>
      <p>These are the prerequisites for <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust"/> on <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/>.</p>
      <div class="noteOkta">
         <p class="noteContent">
            <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust"/> (<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/>) is currently only available to customers who had <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust"/> (<MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/>) and upgraded to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/>.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>General</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Familiarity with <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/>
            <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/>.</li>
         <p>See <MadCap:xref href="../oie-index.htm">Okta [%=okta-feature-names.Identity Engine%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
         <li>An <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> org with the relevant functionality enabled. For details, contact your Okta channel.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Device management</h3>
      <p>To control app access based on device management state, targeted devices must be managed by a device management solution. Note: Devices don't need to be managed for end users to  add an account in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"/> and for the device to appear in <span class="menucascade">
            <span class="uicontrol">Directory</span>
            <span class="uicontrol">Devices</span>
         </span>.</p>
      <h3>Mobile devices</h3>
      <p>Mobile device management requires third-party Mobile Device Management (MDM) software that supports managed app configuration to configure the key-value pair. For best results, integrate with MDM software that can set <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"/> to install silently and automatically on end-user devices when users enroll in your MDM software.</p>
      <p>Okta tested with the following MDM software but other platform-supported solutions should work:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Android: VMware <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-long"/>, Microsoft Intune</li>
         <li>iOS: VMware <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-long"/>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Desktop devices</h3>
      <p>Desktop device management requires a certificate authority (CA) that can issue client certificates to targeted devices, allowing <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> to verify that devices are managed. You can use <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName"/> as CA or provide your own.</p>
      <h4>Using Okta as a CA</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>macOS: Use any device management solution that supports the deployment of an Apple SCEP MDM payload. The procedure in this document assumes you are managing your devices with Jamf Pro and configuring a Static SCEP profile.</li>
         <p>See <MadCap:xref href="okta-ca-static-scep-macos-jamf.htm">Configure Okta as a certificate authority for macOS using Jamf Pro</MadCap:xref>.</p>
         <li>Windows: Okta tested two configurations:<ul>
               <li> Delegated (Dynamic) SCEP method using AD CS and NDES integrated with <MadCap:variable name="3rd Party Integrations.Microsoft Intune"/>
               </li>
               <li>Static SCEP method using <MadCap:variable name="Mobile.WS1-UEM-short"/>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <p>Procedures for both methods are provided in this document.</p>
         <p>See <MadCap:xref href="okta-ca-delegated-scep-win-intune.htm">Configure Okta as a certificate authority for Windows using Intune</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="okta-ca-static-scep-win-ws1.htm">Configure Okta as a certificate authority for Windows using [%=Mobile.WS1%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
      </ul>
      <h4>Provide your own CA</h4>
      <p>If you are not using Okta as a CA, you need to provide your own public key infrastructure (PKI) or CA infrastructure integrated with your MDM software. Okta tested this feature  with Microsoft Intune (for Windows) and  Jamf Pro (for macOS). To prove that devices are managed by your organization, you must configure your CA infrastructure or MDM software to deploy certificates, signed by your organization's certificate authority, to your registered Windows and macOS devices. Deploy certificates for digital signature but not for other purposes, such as encryption. </p>
      <p>See <MadCap:xref href="device-registration.htm">Device registration</MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="config-customer-provided-ca.htm">Provide your own certificate authority for managed devices</MadCap:xref>.</p>
      <h3>Apps</h3>
      <p>SAML, OIDC, and WS-Fed apps. Okta tested with Office 365 and Salesforce, but other apps should work.</p>
      <h3>Browser</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Android: Chrome</li>
         <li>iOS: Safari</li>
         <li>macOS: Safari (required for Credential SSO Extension), Chrome </li>
         <li>Windows: Internet Explorer, Edge, Edge Chromium, Chrome</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Operating system</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Android 7.0 or later</li>
         <li>iOS 13, iOS 14</li>
         <li>macOS 10.15.x (Catalina), and 11 (Big Sur)</li>
         <li>Windows 10, 32-bit and 64-bit</li>
      </ul>
