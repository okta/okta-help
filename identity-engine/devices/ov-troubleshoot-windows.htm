                    <p>Enable detailed logging through the registry by setting the <span class="code">LogLevel</span> key to <span class="code">Debug</span>.</p>

                    <ul>

                            <p>Open the Event View and expand <span class="uicontrol">Application and Services Logs</span>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Right-click <span class="uicontrol">Okta</span> and select <span class="uicontrol">Save All Events As</span>.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Managed devices</h2>
            <p>If the Windows device is a managed device, try the following  troubleshooting steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificate is installed on the device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check whether Okta is the certificate authority that issued the certificate installed on the device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check whether the certificate was issued for all users at the device level or for an individual user of the device.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check the status of the device in your mobile device management software.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check the configuration of the SCEP profile in your mobile device management software to make sure allow all apps access is selected.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that your device management software is set to push managed app configurations to the following preference domains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Preference domain 1: com.okta.mobile</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Preference domain 2: com.okta.mobile.auth-service-extension</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you receive error code 25300 or Failed to create Identity reference for given certificate, this indicates that the SCEP certificate was not installed correctly. Delete the certificate and reinstall it.</p>
            <h2>Endpoint detection and response integration</h2>
            <p>If your endpoint detection and response integration is not working as expected, try the following  troubleshooting steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that the software you are integrating with is installed and configured correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that the software you are integrating with supports managed app configuration.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify the Okta plugin for the integration  was successfully deployed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Check that the device is not registered using the same certificate in another Okta org.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that your device management software is set to push managed app configurations to the following preference domains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
