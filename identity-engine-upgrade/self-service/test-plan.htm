        <h1>Upgrade test plan</h1>
        <p>The test plan for upgrading to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> involves two distinct phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Before you upgrade, record your current experience in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After you upgrade, verify that your experience in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> is the same.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a comprehensive spreadsheet to track your results, see the <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/sample-template-oie-upgrade-test-matrix" target="_blank">Upgrade Test Matrix</a>.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>If you have a Preview environment, Okta recommends performing a full upgrade there first. That means completing both phases of the test plan, so you can see firsthand how the upgrade affects your customizations before you attempt it in a Production org.</p>
        <p>For these tests to be successful, be sure that your Preview org has the same configuration as your Production org. If they don't match, adjust your configurations before you proceed. You can use bookmark apps instead of replicating your SAML apps  in Preview.</p>
        <p>If you don't have a Preview environment but want to review the user experience changes, you can purchase a Preview environment or create an Identity Engine <a href="https://www.okta.com/free-trial/">free trial org</a>. </p>
