        <h1>Self-service upgrade process</h1>
        <p>The self-service upgrade process  ensures that your org's upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> is successful. Most upgrades only take a few minutes to complete, so there's no downtime for admins and end users. Your org configurations are seamlessly migrated to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />.</p>
        <p>Review each of the following steps to familiarize yourself with the upgrade process before you get started. </p>
        <h2>Complete action items</h2>
        <p>There may be some <MadCap:xref href="self-service-action-items.htm">Self-service upgrade action items</MadCap:xref> you need to complete before you can schedule your upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Identity Engine" />.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Access the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> Upgrade Hub in the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard" /> to see the list of action items.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Follow the remediation guides to complete the required action items. Update your configuration according to each action item, and then acknowledge its completion.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>After you complete all action items, you can schedule your upgrade.</p>
        <h2><a name="Schedule"></a>Schedule your upgrade</h2>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have your admins review the <MadCap:xref href="test-plan.htm">Upgrade test plan</MadCap:xref> to understand best practices.</p>
