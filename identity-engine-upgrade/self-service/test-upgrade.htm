        <h1>Test the upgrade in Identity Engine</h1>
        <p>Perform these tests after completing the <MadCap:xref href="self-service-process.htm">Self-service upgrade process</MadCap:xref>. Most upgrades take only a few minutes to complete, so there's no downtime for admins and end users. Your org configurations are seamlessly migrated to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />.</p>
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:xref href="validation-tests.htm">Record your [%=okta-feature-names.Classic Engine%] experience</MadCap:xref>
        </p>
        <h2>Test your policies</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Sign in to your Okta org with a test user account. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that the global session policy correctly evaluates the test user. Your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> policies migrate with two new default settings. See <MadCap:xref href="../okta-sign-on-policy-changes.htm">Okta sign-on policies</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enroll in an MFA authenticator with a test user account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that the authenticator&#160;enrollment policy correctly evaluates the test user. Your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> policies don't change during migration, but some authenticator behavior does. See <MadCap:xref href="../mfa-enrollment-policy-changes.htm">MFA enrollment policy</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sign in to your apps with a test user account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that the authentication policies correctly evaluate the test user. Your Classic Engine app sign-on policies migrate with a few conditions. See <MadCap:xref href="../compare-app-sign-on-policies.htm">App sign-on policy migration</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Attempt to recover your password with a test user account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Verify that self-service password recovery works for the test user. See <MadCap:xref href="../password-reset-account-recovery.htm">Password reset and account recovery</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Test your devices</h2>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, you must use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to secure your mobile and desktop devices.&#160;If you actively used <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, after the upgrade you just need to test your authentication policies.</p>
        <p>If you didn't use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, follow these steps after you upgrade:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Set up Device Trust for mobile and desktop in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"></MadCap:variable>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Test authentication policies.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>See <MadCap:xref href="../dt-mobile-turn-off.htm">Turn off [%=okta-feature-names.Device Trust%] on mobile devices</MadCap:xref> and  <MadCap:xref href="../migrate-from-dt-to-fp-faqs.htm">From [%=okta-feature-names.Device Trust%] to [%=okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass%]</MadCap:xref>.  </p>
        <h2><a name="Test"></a>Test Self-Service Registration</h2>
        <p>When you upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, the Self-Service Registration feature is replaced with the profile enrollment policy. This functionality lets end users self-register with either the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Sign-In Widget" /> (hosted by Okta) or with an embedded solution using an array of SDKs. The profile enrollment policy also lets you incrementally collect profile data as new users engage with other applications. See <MadCap:xref href="../feature-change-ssr.htm">Self-Service Registration</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Test the profile enrollment policy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Refer to your runbook for customizations and styling.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Test Okta SDKs and third-party tools</h2>
        <p>If you use Okta SDKs or third-party tools, ensure that they work in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> after you upgrade. Refer to Okta Developer Documentation for <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/redirect-vs-embedded/" target="_blank">Okta deployment models</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oie-intro/#sdks-and-sample-apps" target="_blank">SDKs and sample apps</a>.</p>
        <h2>Test the user experience</h2>
        <p>After you upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, sign in as that test user and note the sign-in flow and password recovery behavior.   Let your users know about the changes they'll experience in the sign-in, sign-up, and recovery flows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>They may be prompted for their username first, instead of a username and password. See <MadCap:xref href="../siw-changes.htm">Sign-In Widget</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>During sign-up flows, they may be prompted for optional security methods, depending on your profile enrollment policies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The password recovery link is only presented on the page for password entry. Users can't reset their password from the username prompt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Their email messages may contain links (including the URL&#160;for the email magic link). See <MadCap:xref href="../email-enhancements.htm">Email templates</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
