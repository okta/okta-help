        <h1>Post-upgrade validation tests</h1>
        <p>Validation tests ensure that your org performs as expected in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />. </p>
        <p>These are the same tests that you performed in a Preview environment before your upgrade. If your Preview environment matches your Production environment (recommended), these tests should yield the same results. </p>
        <h2>Policies</h2>
        <p>After you upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, policy behavior should be the same as your initial validation tests in Preview.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Validate that the global session policy correctly evaluates your test users. Your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> policies migrate with two new default settings. See <MadCap:xref href="../okta-sign-on-policy-changes.htm">Okta sign-on policies</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li> Validate that the authenticator&#160;enrollment policy correctly evaluates your test users. Your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> policies don't change during migration, but some authenticator behavior does. See <MadCap:xref href="../mfa-enrollment-policy-changes.htm">MFA enrollment policy</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Validate that the authentication policy correctly evaluates your test users. Your Classic Engine app sign-on policies migrate with a few conditions. See <MadCap:xref href="../compare-app-sign-on-policies.htm">App sign-on policy migration</MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li>Validate that self-service password recovery works for your test users. See <MadCap:xref href="../password-reset-account-recovery.htm">Password reset and account recovery</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" />
        </h2>
        <p>In <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, you must use <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> to secure your mobile and desktop devices.&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If you used Device Trust in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, you should have turned off <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> for mobile devices and set up Device Trust for Desktop before the upgrade. In <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, test the authentication policies that let users sign in with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> for Desktop.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you didn't use Device Trust in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, you should have turned off <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> for mobile devices before the upgrade. In <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, set up <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> and then test the authentication policies.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>See <MadCap:xref href="../../identity-engine/devices/devices-main.htm">Devices</MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../migrate-from-dt-to-fp-faqs.htm">From [%=okta-feature-names.Device Trust%] to [%=okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass%]</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Okta SDKs and third-party tools</h2>
        <p>If you use Okta SDKs or third-party tools, ensure that they work in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> after you upgrade. Refer to Okta Developer Documentation for <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/redirect-vs-embedded/" target="_blank">Okta deployment models</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oie-intro/#sdks-and-sample-apps" target="_blank">SDKs and sample apps</a>.</p>
        <h2>User experience</h2>
        <p>After you upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, sign in as a test user and note the sign-in flow and password recovery behavior.   Let your users know about the changes  in the sign-in, sign-up, and recovery flows.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>They may be prompted for their username first, instead of a username and password. See <MadCap:xref href="../siw-changes.htm">Sign-In Widget</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>During sign-up flows, they may be prompted for optional security methods, depending on your profile enrollment policies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The password recovery link is only presented on the page for password entry. Users can't reset their password from the username prompt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Their email messages may contain email message links (including the URL&#160;for email magic link). See <MadCap:xref href="../email-enhancements.htm">Email templates</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
