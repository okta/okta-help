        <p><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> enables device management. On Classic Engine, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> uses mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) to attest that a device is trusted and managed. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> is established by the presence of certificates and has a strong dependency with Jamf (for macOS) and Active Directory (for Windows). On  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" />  uses <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify" /> and management certificates  to attest that a device is trusted (registered and managed).  It works across all mobile device management (MDM) platforms. Devices are managed by an endpoint management tool (for example, Jamf Pro, Workspace ONE, etc.) before end users can access <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />-managed apps. <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> is passwordless authentication. You combine <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> with <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> to obtain strong passwordless authentication on managed, compliant devices.</p>
        <p>There is no automated method for migrating <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" />. After you upgrade from <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, you need to configure <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> and <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta FastPass" /> settings in <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />.</p>
        <p>When you upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, you have to turn off Mobile <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" />. On <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Device Trust" /> uses <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> Mobile to attest that a mobile device is trusted and managed. Okta Mobile is not supported on <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /><MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, so end users can no longer use it to access their apps. Instead, users can access their apps from the <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> End-User Dashboard in a mobile browser.</p>
