        <h1>Behavior after a rollback</h1>
        <p>Your org isn't restored to its previous state after you roll back to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />. If you made org changes in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, some of those changes may persist when you return to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />. Other features are restored to the default settings.</p>
        <h2>Changes that persist</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Users, groups, and applications that you created in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> persist when you roll back.</p>

            <li>
                <p>New users who signed up in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> persist when you roll back.</p>

            <li>
                <p>If you enrolled Phone as an authenticator in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, both SMS&#160;and Phone are available for authentication when you roll back to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />.</p>

                <p>If you disabled Mobile Device Trust or Self-Service Registration in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> before your upgrade, these features remain disabled when you roll back. If you enable them again in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, the settings are restored to the defaults.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Push notifications and TOTP&#160;are enabled, even if you didn't have them enabled in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> before the upgrade.</p>
