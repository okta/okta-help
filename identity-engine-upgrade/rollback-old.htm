      <h1>Rollback to Classic Engine</h1>
      <p>If a problem occurs during the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> upgrade process, Okta provides an option to revert an org to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/>. However, the need to roll back is rare. You can resolve most issues by adjusting certain configurations.</p>
      <p>Follow the <MadCap:xref href="post-upgrade-checklist.htm">Post-upgrade checklist</MadCap:xref> and test critical functionality. If you discover a problem within the first two weeks of testing, Okta  can help you roll back to Classic Engine.</p>
      <h3>Upgrade issues that can require rollback</h3>
      <p>Look for these issues during the 48 hours of testing:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Critical application authentication doesn't work as expected</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>End users can't access their  Okta dashboard</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>End users can't access assigned resources with configured factors</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>New end users can't register an Okta account</p>
         </li>
         <li MadCap:conditions="Primary.do-not-publish">
            <p>Identity sources can't import new users into Okta</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Multifactor Authentication doesn't work for a large volume of users</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Interruptions with JIT / Inbound SAML or user provisioning</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Admins can't access the Admin Console</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Admins can't resolve issues for end users (such as account unlock and password reset)</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Usually, you can resolve these issues by adjusting your org's customization settings. Reach out to <a href="mailto:help@okta.com">your Okta account team</a> if you experience any of these issues after the upgrade.</p>
      <h3>Org behavior after rollback</h3>
      <p>When an org rolls back to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/>, the org behavior can change if admins make changes. </p>
      <p>The following scenarios can occur during the rollback process for both admins and end users:</p>
      <h4>Admin changes</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>New users, groups, and applications created in  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> persist after rollback.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>New authentication policies, global session policies, or policy settings created in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> don't persist, or they fall back to default settings.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Changes to password recovery or MFA enrollments don't persist, or they fall back to default settings.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>New <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> functionality (Okta FastPass, Device Trust v2) is deactivated after rolling back to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Push notifications and TOTP are enabled, even if you didn't enable these factors in your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/> org before the upgrade. If you don't want them enabled, go to <span class="menucascade">
                  <span class="uicontrol">Security</span>
                  <span class="uicontrol">Multifactor</span>
                  <span class="uicontrol">Factor Types</span>
               </span>. Select <span class="uicontrol">
                  <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Okta Verify"/>
               </span>, and then click <span class="uicontrol">Deactivate</span>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>If Phone is enrolled as an authenticator in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/>, both SMS and Voice are available for authentication after rollback.
</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>User changes</h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>Users who set up recovery factors or authentication factors on <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> remain after rolling back to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>User password and profile changes remain after rolling back to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>New users who signed up to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine"/> exist after rolling back to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/>.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Activation or recovery emails and links may not work. You can fix this by generating new activation emails and password reset emails.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>The user Sign-In Widget experience reverts to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/> version.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Security Questions that you configured in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine"/> for both account recovery or MFA  reset to recovery only.</p>
