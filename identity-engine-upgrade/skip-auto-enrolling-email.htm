        <h1>Skip auto-enrolling email authenticator</h1>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/ea-featmgr.flsnp" />
        <p>This feature allows you to upgrade your org to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> without having to auto-enroll the email as an authenticator for your end users.</p>
        <p>Enable this feature before you upgrade your org if any of the following applies to you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> org, you have a factor enrollment policy where email is set as an optional factor.</li>
            <li>Your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" /> org doesn’t use MFA.</li>
            <li>You want to use email as an optional authenticator in your <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> org after migration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When this feature is enabled, you don’t have to set the email factor to <span class="uicontrol">Required</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Disabled</span> when upgrading your org.</p>
        <h2>End-user experience</h2>
        <p>The end user's experience with the first sign-in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> depends on how you have configured the authenticator enrollment policy and account recovery policy.</p>
        <p>The end user’s email isn't automatically enrolled as an authenticator when they first sign in to the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> org after the upgrade. However, they may be prompted to enroll another authenticator for account recovery. In certain cases, they may have to enroll their email as an authenticator.</p>
        <p>Self-service account recovery in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" /> requires that the user enrolls at least one authenticator specified for the recovery purpose. Users use this recovery authenticator to reset their password or unlock their account. In <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />, users can use email for account recovery even if they haven’t enrolled it for authentication. However, in <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, the email must be enrolled as an authenticator to use it for account recovery.</p>
        <p>Therefore, if the user hasn’t enrolled any required authenticator for account recovery, they’re prompted to do so when they first sign in to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> after you upgraded the org to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />. They can choose from the authenticators you’ve made available for self-service account recovery.</p>
