        <h1>Roll back to Classic Engine</h1>
        <p>Immediately after your upgrade to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Identity Engine" />, test and validate your critical functionality. Do this before you make any configuration changes to ensure that the upgrade was successful. If you find an issue that you can't resolve within seven days of your upgrade, Okta will make a best effort to roll back your org to <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Classic Engine" />.</p>
        <h2>Which issues don't require a rollback?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Support or functionality of a feature changed. <MadCap:xref href="features.htm">Feature changes</MadCap:xref> are expected and intentional.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Custom code doesn't function according to your required use case. You should test all custom code and critical use cases (including infrastructure management services like Terraform) in a non-production environment before upgrading your production environment. This lets you identify the changes you need to make during the production change control execution. Refer to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/oie-upgrade-overview/main/" target="_blank">Okta developer docs</a> to understand the integration patterns for custom development.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Which"></a>Which issues require a rollback?</h2>
        <p>Most issues that you find during testing can be resolved by adjusting your configurations. Refer to the <MadCap:xref href="post-upgrade-checklist.htm">Post-upgrade tasks</MadCap:xref>.</p>
