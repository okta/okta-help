      <h1>Suspend and unsuspend users</h1>
      <p>
         <a name="Suspending"/>Suspending people in your organization is useful if you have temporary and contract workers, or when your employees are on leaves of absence. You may also want to suspend a user who has permanently left your organization so that you can review their group and app assignments. Suspended users' app and group memberships are maintained and are reinstated when the user is unsuspended. </p>
