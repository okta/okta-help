        <p>Use Anything-as-a-Source (XaaS) to integrate any source of truth with Okta and benefit from HR-driven provisioning. XaaS gives you the flexibility to define the terms of synchronization between Okta and the source of truth. Alternatively, some identities don't require representation in Okta, and Anything-as-a-Source can  filter out irrelevant data, syncing only the appropriate identities.</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>Anything-as-a-Source has the following limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>XaaS&#160;can't use import scheduling, import safeguards (app-level or org-level), or user import inline hooks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bulk imports are limited to 10K users per single session.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bulk imports are done at 200 users per batch, and up to 50 POST requests can be made in a single import session.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>There are no APIs for account matching, linking, or profile mapping.  Admins have to rely on the Okta Admin Dashboard to configure account matching and linking policies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Listing the same user twice in a session can result in data inaccuracy issues (such as a race condition or profile conflict).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Sending an empty profile creates an empty user, which isn't recommended by Okta.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Connecting XaaS to an existing integration with Okta (such as Workday) can result in data inaccuracy issues, and is not supported by Okta.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
