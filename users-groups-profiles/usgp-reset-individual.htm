      <h1>Reset a user password</h1>
      <p>
         <a name="To"/>Password reset functionality is available for orgs using Active Directory (AD) and LDAP.</p>
      <h2>AD-sourced users in a Delegated Authentication environment</h2>
      <p>When a password is reset, the original password doesn't expire in AD.  If the user remembers their original AD password, they can use it to sign in despite the password reset.</p>
      <p>If  you use the <span class="uicontrol">Temporary Password</span> option for an account along with the <span class="uicontrol">Password never expires</span> option enabled, the user isn't prompted to change their password after entering the temporary password.</p>
      <h2>LDAP-sourced users in a Delegated Authentication environment</h2>
      <p>If an admin creates a temporary password for LDAP-sourced users, users must change their password the next time they sign in if the LDAP server password policy requires or allows it. To create password policies that support temporary passwords, consult the LDAP server manual provided by the vendor.</p>
