        <h1><a name="AddPeople"></a>About manual group user management</h1>
        <p>You can manually manage users in a group, even if other users in the group are managed by rules. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A user who is manually added to a group is managed <span class="term">Manually</span>.</li>
            <li>If a new rule adds users to that group, and the manually managed user meets the new rule's conditions, that user becomes managed <span class="term">By rule ABC.</span></li>
            <li>If a rule-managed user is manually removed from a group, the user is automatically added to the rule's <span class="uicontrol">Except The following users</span> field.</li>
            <li>When you add or remove users from a group, the process runs as a background task, and depending on the number of users being added or removed, can take significant time to complete. During the addition or removal process, the <span class="uicontrol">Manage People</span> button is inactive, and a notification appears indicating the progress of the request. Another notification appears when the  request completes successfully.</li>
        </ul>
