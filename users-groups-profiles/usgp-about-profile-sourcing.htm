        <h1><a name="top"></a>About profile sourcing</h1>
        <p>A profile source is an application that acts as the source of truth for user identities. Once enabled from the <span class="uicontrol">Provisioning</span> tab of the app or directory, it appears in the profile source list on the <span class="uicontrol">Profile Sources</span> page. If an  external profile source is not identified, <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> is the source for all profiles. </p>
        <p>If more than one profile source is listed on the <span class="uicontrol">Profile Sources </span>page, you can prioritize them so that user profile attributes can be sourced by different systems, based on their assignments. At any given time, there can only be one profile source for a user's profile.</p>
        <p>Profile sources are powerful tools that can help you manage a user's entire life cycle (creation, updates, and deactivation). For example, use Workday as a profile source to send user creation, updates, and termination events from Workday to <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p> Here are some of the apps and directories that allow profile sourcing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Active Directory</li>
            <li>BambooHR</li>
            <li>G Suite</li>
            <li>LDAP</li>
            <li>NetSuite</li>
            <li>Namely (built by ISV)</li>
            <li>Salesforce</li>
            <li>SuccessFactors</li>
            <li>UltiPro</li>
            <li>Workday</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Enable Profile Source and Update User Attributes</h2>
        <p>Enabling Profile Source and Update User Attributes for the same application lets you push Okta to App profile mappings to the highest priority profile source. This is beneficial when you want to sync attributes such as an email address and phone number from downstream applications back to the profile source. However, you may lose data if an app that designated as a profile source can also receive profile updates from <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p>Before you enable Profile Source and Update User Attributes for the same app, consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unwanted profile pushes - <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> updates can overwrite the values of unmapped attributes in an app, even if that app is the highest priority profile source. For example, if the <span class="uicontrol">cn</span> attribute is not mapped from Active Directory to  <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />, and you've configured Active Directory for  Profile Source and Update User Attributes, - <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> applies default mapping to <span class="uicontrol">cn</span>.</li>
            <li>Overwritten IdP-sourced attributes - <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to app updates can overwrite attributes that are sourced by another identity source. There's no partial push option.</li>
            <li>Race conditions - <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> can overwrite an updated attribute in an identity source before other updates are pushed back to - <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" />. For example, consider a scenario in which a user's first name and last name are imported into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> from a directory, but the user's email address is imported into <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> from an app. If the user's last name changes in the directory before the applicable email address update is made in the app, - <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> could push the new name and the old email address. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Rules for incoming imports			</h2>
        <p> Using a profile source necessitates a clear distinction between new imported users and updates to current <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> users. <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> uses matching rules to  maintain a link between the profile source  and <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> to prevent conflicts. See User Creation &amp; Matching in <a href="../Apps/Provisioning_Deprovisioning_Overview.htm">Provisioning and Deprovisioning</a>. 
</p>
        <h2><a name="Profile"></a>Profile sourcing and the user life cycle</h2>
        <p>The flow of a user's identity throughout the different cycles of access (creation, update, and removal of access to resources) is known as a user’s life cycle. A profile sourcer can determine the beginning or end of this cycle, and is enabled within the provisioning and import space. </p>
