        <h1>About group rules</h1>
        <p>Group rules simplify group administration and help you manage application access, application roles, and security policies. </p>
        <p>Groups are commonly used for <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> single sign-on (SSO) access   and to provision users to apps with specific entitlements. When you use rules to populate groups based on attributes, you achieve attribute-based access control. You can create rules using single or multiple attributes, single or multiple groups, or combinations of attributes and groups. </p>
        <p>Use group  rules to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Map multiple Active Directory (AD) groups to a single </span><MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" style="font-weight: bold;" /><span class="uicontrol"> group.</span> You can also use rules to map <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> groups to AD groups.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Populate AD groups based on  user attributes.</span> Rules are particularly useful in "Workday (WD) as a source" setups for which <MadCap:variable name="okta-variables.ProductName" /> provisions users and groups to AD. For example, use the <span class="uicontrol">cost center</span> attribute from WD to determine AD group memberships.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Simplify the management of groups.</span> Instead of manually adding users to a group, you can define a rule that automatically adds users with the required attribute. For example, a user with the <span class="uicontrol">department </span>= "sales" is automatically added to the Sales group. When a user's <span class="uicontrol">department</span> attribute changes,  the user is removed from the Sales group automatically. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="uicontrol">Automate provisioning.</span> Instead of manually provisioning users to an app, you can define a rule that automatically provisions users with the required attribute. For example, 						if user profile attribute == X, then provision app Y with Role Z.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep the following restrictions in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orgs can have a maximum of 2000 rules.</li>
            <li>Group rules can't be used to assign users to admin groups.</li>
            <li>You can only use string attributes in basic condition group rules. </li>
            <li>A group that is already the target of a group rule can't be granted admin privileges.</li>
            <li>Only super admins and org admins can edit rules.</li>
            <li>Only group admins who manage all groups can search for and view rules. Individual group admins can't search for or view rules.</li>
        </ul>
