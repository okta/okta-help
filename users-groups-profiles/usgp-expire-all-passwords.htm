      <h1>Expire all user passwords</h1>
      <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Expire Passwords</span> feature allows you to expire passwords of <span class="uicontrol">all</span> Okta-sourced users. Every Okta-sourced user will be forced to change their password the next time they sign in. Super admin or Org admin permissions are required to use this functionality.</p>
      <p>Before you expire all user passwords, consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Active sessions remain active. The user is prompted for a new password the next time they sign in.</li>
         <li>You can use the <span class="uicontrol">App Password Health Report</span> on the Reports page to monitor how your users reset their passwords.</li>
         <li>API tokens are not expired. API tokens are valid for 30 days and renew automatically with each request to Okta. For more information on API token expiration and revocation, see <MadCap:xref href="../Security/API.htm">API tokens</MadCap:xref>.</li>
         <li>Bulk password expiration only applies to <span class="uicontrol">Okta-managed</span> users, unless the Active Directory Password Reset or LDAP Password Reset feature is enabled.  When password reset functionality is enabled, the passwords of users managed with Active Directory or LDAP delegated authentication are also expired. Your Active Directory and LDAP agents will continue to work even if the service account managed by Okta has an expired password. </li>
         <li>If you are responding to a security vulnerability, ensure that your applications are already patched and no longer vulnerable before resetting the Okta password.</li>
         <li>When a user's Okta password is changed, all applications assigned to the user that support Provisioning and are Sync Password enabled are updated with the new password.</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
         <li>
                In the <MadCap:variable name="okta-feature-names.Administrator dashboard"/>, go to <span class="menucascade">
